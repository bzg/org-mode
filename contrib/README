This directory contains add-ons to Org-mode.

These contributions are not part of GNU Emacs or of the official Org-mode
package.  But the git repository for Org-mode is glad to provide useful way
to distribute and develop them as long as they are distributed under a free
software license.

Please put your contribution in one of these three directories:
