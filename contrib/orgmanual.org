   :DESCRIPTION: Brief summary of what Org-mode does
   :END:
#+cindex: summary

Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and doing
project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.

Org develops organizational tasks around NOTES files that contain
lists or information about projects as plain text.  Org is implemented
on top of Outline mode, which makes it possible to keep the content of
large files well structured.  Visibility cycling and structure editing
help to work with the tree.  Tables are easily created with a built-in
table editor.  Org supports TODO items, deadlines, timestamps, and
scheduling.  It dynamically compiles entries into an agenda that
utilizes and smoothly integrates much of the Emacs calendar and diary.
Plain text URL-like links connect to websites, emails, Usenet
messages, BBDB entries, and any files related to the projects.  For
printing and sharing of notes, an Org file can be exported as a
structured ASCII file, as HTML, or as an iCalendar file.[fn:1]  It can
also serve as a publishing tool for a set of linked web pages.

As a project planning environment, Org works by adding metadata to
outline nodes.  Based on this data, specific entries can be extracted
in queries and create dynamic /agenda views/.

Org mode contains the Org Babel environment which allows you to work
with embedded source code blocks in a file, to facilitate code
evaluation, documentation, and literate programming techniques.

Org's automatic, context-sensitive table editor with spreadsheet
capabilities can be integrated into any major mode by activating the
minor Orgtbl mode.  Using a translation step, it can be used to
maintain tables in arbitrary file types, for example in LaTeX.  The
structure editing and list creation capabilities can be used outside
Org with the minor Orgstruct mode.

Org keeps simple things simple.  When first fired up, it should feel
like a straightforward, easy to use outliner.  Complexity is not
imposed, but a large amount of functionality is available when you
need it.  Org is a toolbox and can be used in different ways and for
different ends, for example:

  - an outline extension with visibility cycling and structure editing
  - an ASCII system and table editor for taking structured notes
  - a TODO list editor
  - a full agenda and planner with deadlines and work scheduling
    #+pindex: GTD, Getting Things Done
  - an environment in which to implement David Allen's GTD system
  - a simple hypertext system, with HTML and LaTeX export
  - a publishing tool to create a set of interlinked web pages
  - an environment for literate programming

** Installation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: How to install a downloaded version of Org-mode
   :END:

#+cindex: installation
#+cindex: XEmacs

*Important:* If you have the version of Org that comes with Emacs or
as a XEmacs package, please skip this section and go directly to
[[Activation]].  If you downloaded Org as an ELPA package, please read the
instructions on the [[https://orgmode.org/elpa.html][Org ELPA page]].  To see what version of Org (if any)
is part of your Emacs distribution, type {{{kbd(M-x org-version)}}}.[fn:2]

Installation of Org mode uses a build system, which is described in more
detail on [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-build-system.html][Worg]].

If you have downloaded Org from the Web as a distribution {{{file(.zip)}}} or
{{{file(.tar.gz)}}} archive, take the following steps to install it:

  - Unpack the distribution archive
  - Change into (~cd~) the Org directory
  - Run ~make help config~ and then check and edit the file
    {{{file(local.mk)}}} if the default configuration does not match
    your system

    - Set the name of the Emacs binary (likely either
      {{{file(emacs)}}} or {{{file(xemacs)}}}), and the paths to the
      directories where local Lisp and Info files will be installed
    - If the Emacs binary is not in your path, give the full path to
      the executable
    - Avoid spaces in any path names

  - Run ~make config~ again to check the configuration
  - Run ~make install~ or ~sudo make install~ to build and install Org
    mode on your system

If you use a cloned Git repository, then the procedure is slightly
different.  The following description assumes that you are using the
~master~ branch.[fn:3] You could also use the ~maint~ branch instead,
where the release versions are published, just replace ~master~ with
~maint~ in the description below.

  - Change into (~cd~) the Org repository
  - Run ~git checkout master~ to switch to the ~master~ branch of the
    Org repository
  - Run ~make help~ and then check and edit the file {{{file(local.mk)}}}

    - You must set the name of the Emacs binary
      (likely either {{{file(emacs)}}} or {{{file(xemacs)}}}), and the
      paths to the directories where local Lisp and Info files will be
      installed
    - If the Emacs binary is not in your path, you must give
      the full path to the executable
    - Avoid spaces in any path names

  - Run ~make config~ to check the configuration
  - Optionally run ~make test~ to build Org mode and then run the full
    test suite
  - Run ~make update2~ or ~make up2~ to update the Git repository and
    build and install Org mode.  The latter invocation runs the
    complete test suite before installation and installs only if the
    build passes all tests

If you don't have access to the system-wide directories and you don't
want to install somewhere into your home directory, you can run Org
directly from the distribution directory or Org repository by
compiling Org mode in place:

  - Change into (~cd~) the Org repository
  - Run ~git checkout master~ to switch to the ~master~ branch of the
    Org repository
  - Run ~make compile~

Last but not least you can also run Org mode directly from an Org repository
without any compilation.  Simply replace the last step in the recipe above
with ~make uncompiled~.

Then add the following line to {{{file(.emacs)}}}:

#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/orgdir/lisp")
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}}
If you plan to use code files from the {{{file(contrib)}}} subdirectory without
compiling them, do a similar step for this directory:

#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/orgdir/contrib/lisp" t)
#+end_src

If you want to include those files with the build and install, please
customize the variable ~ORG_ADD_CONTRIB~ instead in your
~local.mk~ file.  For more details please see this
[[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-build-system.html#sec-4-1-2][description on Worg]].

Installing Info files is system dependent, because of differences in
the {{{file(install-info)}}} program.  The Info documentation is
installed together with the rest of Org mode.  If you don't install Org
mode, it is possible to install the Info documentation separately if you
have install-info on your system.[fn:4]  

The command to do this is:

#+begin_example
   make install-info
#+end_example

Do not forget to activate Org as described in the following section.
{{{page}}}

** Activation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: How to activate Org-mode for certain buffers
   :END:
#+cindex: activation
#+cindex: autoload

#+cindex: global key bindings
#+cindex: key bindings, global
#+findex: org-agenda
#+findex: org-capture
#+findex: org-store-link
#+findex: org-switchb

Since Emacs 22.2, files with the {{{file(.org)}}} extension use Org mode by
default.  If you are using an earlier version of Emacs, add this line to your
{{{file(.emacs)}}} file:

#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.org\\'" . org-mode))
#+end_src

Org mode buffers need font-lock to be turned on - this is the default in
Emacs.[fn:5]

There are compatibility issues between Org mode and some other Elisp
packages, please take the time to check the list (see [[Conflicts]]).

The four Org commands {{{command(org-store-link)}}},
{{{command(org-capture)}}}, {{{command(org-agenda)}}}, and
{{{command(org-switchb)}}} should be accessible through global keys
(i.e., anywhere in Emacs, not just in Org buffers).  Here are
suggested bindings for these keys, please modify the keys to your own
liking.

#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)
(global-set-key "\C-cc" 'org-capture)
(global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
(global-set-key "\C-cb" 'org-switchb)
#+end_src

#+cindex: Org mode, turning on
With this setup, all files with extension {{{samp(.org)}}} will be put
into Org mode.  As an alternative, make the first line of a file look
like this:

#+begin_example
   MY PROJECTS    -*- mode: org; -*-
#+end_example

#+vindex: org-insert-mode-line-in-empty-file
{{{noindent}}}
which will select Org mode for this buffer no matter what the file's
name is.  See also the variable
~org-insert-mode-line-in-empty-file~.

Many commands in Org work on the region if the region is /active/.  To
make use of this, you need to have ~transient-mark-mode~
(~zmacs-regions~ in XEmacs) turned on.  In Emacs 23 this is the
default, in Emacs 22 you need to do this yourself with

#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(transient-mark-mode 1)
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} If you do not like ~transient-mark-mode~, you can
create an active region by using the mouse to select a region, or
pressing {{{kbdkey(C-,SPC)}}} twice before moving the cursor.

** Feedback
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Bug reports, ideas, patches, etc.
   :END:
#+cindex: feedback
#+cindex: bug reports
#+cindex: maintainer
#+cindex: author

If you find problems with Org, or if you have questions, remarks, or
ideas about it, please mail to the Org mailing list
[[mailto:emacs-orgmode@gnu.org]].  If you are not a member of
the mailing list, your mail will be passed to the list after a
moderator has approved it.[fn:6]

For bug reports, please first try to reproduce the bug with the latest
version of Org available---if you are running an outdated version, it
is quite possible that the bug has been fixed already.  If the bug
persists, prepare a report and provide as much information as
possible, including the version information of Emacs ({{{kbdspckey(M-x
emacs-version,RET)}}}) and Org ({{{kbdspckey(M-x org-version,RET)}}}),
as well as the Org related setup in {{{file(.emacs)}}}.  The easiest
way to do this is to use the command {{{kbd(M-x
org-submit-bug-report)}}}, which will put all this information into an
Emacs mail buffer so that you only need to add your description.  If
you are not sending the Email from within Emacs, please copy and paste
the content into your Email program.

Sometimes you might face a problem due to an error in your Emacs or
Org mode setup.  Before reporting a bug, it is very helpful to start
Emacs with minimal customizations and reproduce the problem.  Doing so
often helps you determine if the problem is with your customization or
with Org mode itself.  You can start a typical minimal session with a
command like the example below.

#+begin_src sh :exports code
$ emacs -Q -l /path/to/minimal-org.el
#+end_src

However if you are using Org mode distributed with Emacs, a minimal
setup is not necessary.  In that case it is sufficient to start Emacs
as ~emacs -Q~.  The ~minimal-org.el~ setup
file can have contents as shown below.

#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;;; Minimal setup to load latest `org-mode'

;; activate debugging
(setq debug-on-error t
      debug-on-signal nil
      debug-on-quit nil)

;; add latest org-mode to load path
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "/path/to/org-mode/lisp"))
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "/path/to/org-mode/contrib/lisp" t))
#+end_src

If an error occurs, a backtrace can be very useful (see [[How to
create a useful backtrace]]).  Often a small example file helps, along
with clear information about:

  1. What exactly did you do?
  2. What did you expect to happen?
  3. What happened instead?

{{{noindent}}} Thank you for helping to improve this program.

** How to create a useful backtrace
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: The best way to report an error
   :END:

#+cindex: backtrace of an error

If working with Org produces an error with a message you don't
understand, you may have hit a bug.  The best way to report this is by
providing, in addition to what was mentioned above, a /backtrace/.
This is information from the built-in debugger about where and how the
error occurred.  Here is how to produce a useful backtrace:

  1. Reload uncompiled versions of all Org mode Lisp files.  The
     backtrace contains much more information if it is produced with
     uncompiled code.  To do this, use
     {{{kbdspckey(C-u M-x org-reload,RET)}}} or select 
     ~Org -> Refresh/Reload -> Reload Org uncompiled~ from the menu.

  2. Go to the ~Options~ menu and select ~Enter Debugger on Error~
     (XEmacs has this option in the ~Troubleshooting~ sub-menu).

  3. Do whatever you have to do to hit the error.  Don't forget to
     document the steps you take.

  4. When you hit the error, a {{{file(*Backtrace*)}}} buffer will
     appear on the screen.  Save this buffer to a file (for example
     using {{{kbd(C-x C-w)}}}) and attach it to your bug report.

** Conventions
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Typesetting conventions in the manual
   :END:

Conventions for typesetting keywords, keybindings, and commands in
this manual are described.

*** Three types of keywords
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: TODO, tags, and properties
    :END:

Org mainly uses three types of keywords: TODO keywords, tags and property
names.  In this manual we use the following conventions:

  - TODO, WAITING :: TODO keywords are written with all capitals, even if they
    are user-defined.
  - boss, ARCHIVE :: User-defined tags are written in lowercase; built-in
               tags with special meaning are written with all capitals.
  - Release, PRIORITY :: User-defined properties are capitalized; built-in
                properties with special meaning are written with all capitals.

Moreover, Org uses /option keywords/ (like ~#+TITLE~ to set the title)
and /environment keywords/ (like ~#+BEGIN_HTML~ to start a ~HTML~
environment).  They are written in uppercase in the manual to enhance
its readability, but you can use lowercase in your Org files.[fn:7]

*** Keybindings and commands
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Bind useful commands to keys
    :END:

#+kindex: C-c a
#+findex: org-agenda
#+kindex: C-c c
#+findex: org-capture

The manual suggests two global keybindings: {{{kbd(C-c a)}}} for
~org-agenda~ and {{{kbd(C-c c)}}} for ~org-capture~.  These are only
suggestions, but the rest of the manual assumes that you are using
these keybindings.

Also, the manual lists both the keys and the corresponding commands
for accessing a functionality.  Org mode often uses the same key for
different functions, depending on context.  The command that is bound
to such keys has a generic name, like ~org-metaright~.  In the manual
we will, wherever possible, give the function that is internally
called by the generic command.  For example, in the chapter on document
structure, {{{kbdkey(M-,right)}}} will be listed to call
~org-do-demote~, while in the chapter on tables, it will be listed to
call ~org-table-move-column-right~. 

# If you prefer, you can compile the manual without the command names by unsetting the flag ~cmdnames~ in {{{file(org.texi)}}}.

* Document structure
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: A tree works like your brain
  :ALT_TITLE: Document Structure
  :END:
#+cindex: document structure
#+cindex: structure of document

Org is based on Outline mode and provides flexible commands to
edit the structure of the document.

** Outlines
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Org mode is based on Outline mode
   :END:
#+cindex: outlines
#+cindex: Outline mode

Org is implemented on top of Outline mode.  Outlines allow a document
to be organized in a hierarchical structure, which (at least for me)
is the best representation of notes and thoughts.  An overview of this
structure is achieved by folding (hiding) large parts of the document
to show only the general document structure and the parts currently
being worked on.  Org greatly simplifies the use of outlines by
compressing the entire show/hide functionality into a single command,
{{{command(org-cycle)}}}, which is bound to the {{{key(TAB)}}} key.

** Headlines
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: How to typeset Org tree headlines
   :END:
#+cindex: headlines
#+cindex: outline tree
#+vindex: org-special-ctrl-a/e
#+vindex: org-special-ctrl-k
#+vindex: org-ctrl-k-protect-subtree

Headlines define the structure of an outline tree.  The headlines in Org
start with one or more stars, on the left margin.[fn:8]  For example:

#+begin_src org
  ,* Top level headline
  ,** Second level
  ,*** Third level
      some text
  ,*** Third level
      more text
  ,* Another top level headline
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} Some people find the many stars too noisy and would
prefer an outline that has whitespace followed by a single star as
headline starters.  A setup to realize this is described in the
section, [[Clean view]]. 

#+vindex: org-cycle-separator-lines
An empty line after the end of a subtree is considered part of it and
will be hidden when the subtree is folded.  However, if you leave at
least two empty lines, one empty line will remain visible after folding
the subtree, in order to structure the collapsed view.  See the
variable ~org-cycle-separator-lines~ to modify this behavior.

** Visibility cycling
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Show and hide, much simplified
   :ALT_TITLE: Visibility cycling
   :END:
#+cindex: cycling, visibility
#+cindex: visibility cycling
#+cindex: trees, visibility
#+cindex: show hidden text
#+cindex: hide text

Outlines make it possible to hide parts of the text in the buffer.
Org uses just two commands, bound to {{{key(TAB)}}} and
{{{kbdkey(S-,TAB)}}} to change the visibility in the buffer.

#+cindex: subtree visibility states
#+cindex: subtree cycling
#+cindex: folded, subtree visibility state
#+cindex: children, subtree visibility state
#+cindex: subtree, subtree visibility state

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{key(TAB)}}}, ~org-cycle~ :: Subtrees can be cycled through three
     states:
     #+kindex: TAB
     #+findex: org-cycle
     
     #+begin_src example
       ,-> FOLDED -> CHILDREN -> SUBTREE --.
       '-----------------------------------'
     #+end_src

     #+vindex: org-cycle-emulate-tab
     #+vindex: org-cycle-global-at-bob

     By default, the cursor must be on a headline for this to work,
     but this behavior can be modified with the
     ~org-cycle-emulate-tab~ option.  When the cursor is at the
     beginning of the buffer and the first line is not a headline,
     then {{{key(TAB)}}} actually runs global cycling (see
     below).[fn:9] Also, when called with a prefix argument
     ({{{kbdspckey(C-u,TAB)}}}), global cycling is invoked.

- {{{kbdkey(S-,TAB)}}} or {{{kbdspckey(C-u,TAB)}}}, ~org-global-cycle~ :: 
     Global cycling: Rotate the entire buffer among the states

     #+cindex: global visibility states
     #+cindex: global cycling
     #+cindex: overview, global visibility state
     #+cindex: contents, global visibility state
     #+cindex: show all, global visibility state
     #+kindex: C-u TAB
     #+kindex: S-TAB
     #+findex: org-global-cycle

     #+begin_example
        ,-> OVERVIEW -> CONTENTS -> SHOW ALL --.
        '--------------------------------------'
     #+end_example

     When {{{kbdkey(S-,TAB)}}} is called with a numeric prefix
     argument, ~N~, the CONTENTS view up to headlines of level N will
     be shown.  Note that inside tables, {{{kbdkey(S-,TAB)}}} jumps
     to the previous field.

- {{{kbdspckey(C-u C-u C-u,TAB)}}}, ~show-all~ :: Show all, including
     drawers.

     #+kindex: C-u C-u C-u TAB
     #+findex: show-all
     #+cindex: show all, command
- {{{kbd(C-c C-r)}}}, ~org-reveal~ :: Reveal context around point,
     showing the current entry, the following heading and the
     hierarchy above.  Useful for working near a location that has
     been exposed by a sparse tree command (see [[Sparse trees]]) or an
     agenda command (see [[Agenda commands]]).  With a prefix argument
     show, on each level, all sibling headings.  With a double prefix
     argument, also show the entire subtree of the parent.

     #+cindex: revealing context
     #+kindex: C-c C-r
     #+findex: org-reveal
- {{{kbd(C-c C-k)}}}, ~show-branches~ :: Expose all the headings of
     the subtree, CONTENT view for just one subtree.

     #+kindex: C-c C-k
     #+findex: show-branches
     #+cindex: show branches, command
- {{{kbdspckey(C-c,TAB)}}}, ~show-children~ :: Expose all direct
     children of the subtree.  With a numeric prefix argument, ~N~,
     expose all children down to level N.

     #+kindex: C-c TAB
     #+findex: show-children
     #+cindex: show children, command
- {{{kbd(C-c C-x b)}}}, ~org-tree-to-indirect-buffer~ :: Show the
     current subtree in an indirect buffer.[fn:10] With a numeric
     prefix argument, ~N~, go up to level N and then take that tree.
     If N is negative then go up that many levels.  With a
     {{{kbd(C-u)}}} prefix, do not remove the previously used indirect
     buffer.

     #+kindex: C-c C-x b
     #+findex: org-tree-to-indirect-buffer
- {{{kbd(C-c C-x v)}}}, ~org-copy-visible~ :: Copy the /visible/ text
     in the region into the kill ring.

#+vindex: org-startup-folded
#+cindex: ~overview~, STARTUP keyword
#+cindex: ~content~, STARTUP keyword
#+cindex: ~showall~, STARTUP keyword
#+cindex: ~showeverything~, STARTUP keyword

When Emacs first visits an Org file, the global state is set to
OVERVIEW, i.e., only the top level headlines are visible.  This can be
configured through the variable ~org-startup-folded~, or on a
per-file basis by adding one of the following lines anywhere in the
buffer:

#+begin_src org 
  ,#+STARTUP: overview
  ,#+STARTUP: content
  ,#+STARTUP: showall
  ,#+STARTUP: showeverything
#+end_src

#+cindex: property, VISIBILITY

{{{noindent}}} Furthermore, any entries with a {{{samp(VISIBILITY)}}}
property (see [[Properties and columns]]) will get their visibility
adapted accordingly.  Allowed values for this property are ~folded~,
~children~, ~content~, and ~all~.

#+attr_texinfo: :indic @asis
- {{{kbdspckey(C-u C-u,TAB)}}}, ~org-set-startup-visibility~ :: Switch
     back to the startup visibility of the buffer, i.e., whatever is
     requested by startup options and {{{samp(VISIBILITY)}}}
     properties in individual entries.

** Motion
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Jumping to other headlines
   :END:
#+cindex: motion, between headlines
#+cindex: jumping, to headlines
#+cindex: headline navigation
The following commands jump to other headlines in the buffer.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
  - {{{kbd(C-c C-n)}}}, ~outline-next-visible-heading~ :: Next heading.
       #+kindex: C-c C-n

When there is an active region (Transient Mark mode), promotion and
demotion work on all headlines in the region.  To select a region of
headlines, it is best to place both point and mark at the beginning of
a line, mark at the beginning of the first headline, and point at the
line just after the last headline to change.  Note that when the
cursor is inside a table (see [[Tables]]), the Meta-Cursor keys have
different functionality.

** Sparse trees

An important feature of Org mode is the ability to construct /sparse
trees/ for selected information in an outline tree, so that the entire
document is folded as much as possible, but the selected information
is made visible along with the headline structure above it.[fn:12]
Just try it out and you will see immediately how it works.

Org mode contains several commands creating such trees, all these
commands can be accessed through a dispatcher:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
  - {{{kbd(C-c /)}}}, ~org-sparse-tree~ :: This prompts for an extra
       key to select a sparse-tree creating command.

  - {{{kbd(C-c / r)}}}, ~org-occur~ :: Prompts for a regexp and shows a
       sparse tree with all matches.  If the match is in a headline,
       the headline is made visible.  If the match is in the body of an
       entry, headline and body are made visible.  In order to provide
       minimal context, also the full hierarchy of headlines above the
       match is shown, as well as the headline following the
       match.  Each match is also highlighted; the highlights disappear
       when the buffer is changed by an editing command, or by
       pressing {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}}.[fn:13] When called with a {{{kbd(C-u)}}}
       prefix argument, previous highlights are kept, so several calls
       to this command can be stacked.

       #+kindex: C-c / r
       #+findex: org-occur

#+vindex: org-agenda-custom-commands

{{{noindent}}} For frequently used sparse trees of specific search
strings, you can use the variable ~org-agenda-custom-commands~ to
define fast keyboard access to specific sparse trees.  These commands
will then be accessible through the agenda dispatcher
(see [[Agenda dispatcher]]).  For example:

#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
        '(("f" occur-tree "FIXME")))
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} will define the key {{{kbd(C-c a f)}}} as a
shortcut for creating a sparse tree matching the string
{{{samp(FIXME)}}}.

The other sparse tree commands select headings based on TODO keywords,
tags, or properties and will be discussed later in this manual.

#+kindex: C-c C-e v
#+cindex: printing sparse trees
#+cindex: visible text, printing

To print a sparse tree, you can use the Emacs command
~ps-print-buffer-with-faces~ which does not print
invisible parts of the document.[fn:14] Or you can use the command
{{{kbd(C-c C-e v)}}} to export only the visible part of the
document and print the resulting file.

** Plain lists
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Additional structure within an entry
   :ALT_TITLE: Plain lists
   :END:
#+cindex: plain lists
#+cindex: lists, plain
#+cindex: lists, ordered
#+cindex: ordered lists

Within an entry of the outline tree, hand-formatted lists can provide
additional structure.  They also provide a way to create lists of
checkboxes (see [[Checkboxes]]).  Org supports editing
such lists, and every exporter (see [[Exporting]])
can parse and format them.

Org knows ordered lists, unordered lists, and description lists.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @bullet
  - /Unordered/ list items start with ~-~, ~+~, or ~*~ as bullets.[fn:15]

  - /Ordered/ list items start with a numeral followed by either a
    period or a right parenthesis,[fn:16] such as
    ~1.~ or ~1~.[fn:170] If you want a list to
    start with a different value (e.g., 20), start the text of the
    item with ~[@20]~.[fn:17] Those constructs can be used
    in any item of the list in order to enforce a particular
    numbering.
    #+vindex: org-plain-list-ordered-item-terminator
    #+vindex: org-alphabetical-lists

  - /Description/ list items are unordered list items, and contain the
    separator {{{samp( :: )}}} to distinguish the description
    /term/ from the description.


Items belonging to the same list must have the same indentation on the
first line.  In particular, if an ordered list reaches number
{{{samp(10.)}}}, then the 2--digit numbers must be written
left-aligned with the other numbers in the list.  An item ends before
the next line that is less or equally indented than its bullet/number.

#+vindex: org-empty-line-terminates-plain-lists
A list ends whenever every item has ended, which means before any line less
or equally indented than items at top level.  It also ends before two blank
lines.[fn:171]  In that case, all items are closed.  Here is an example:

#+begin_src texinfo
  ,** Lord of the Rings                                
     My favorite scenes are (in this order)
     1. The attack of the Rohirrim
     2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
        + this was already my favorite scene in the book
        + I really like Miranda Otto.
     3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
        - on DVD only
        He makes a really funny face when it happens.
     But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
     Important actors in this film are:
     - @b{Elijah Wood} :: He plays Frodo
     - @b{Sean Austin} :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember
       him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in @i{The Goonies}.
#+end_src

Org supports these lists by tuning filling and wrapping commands to
deal with them correctly.[fn:18] To turn this on, put into
{{{file(.emacs)}}}: ~(require 'filladapt)~}, and by exporting them
properly (see [[Exporting]]).  Since indentation is
what governs the structure of these lists, many structural constructs
like ~#+BEGIN_ ...~ blocks can be indented to signal that they belong
to a particular item.

#+vindex: org-list-demote-modify-bullet
#+vindex: org-list-indent-offset
If you find that using a different bullet for a sub-list (than that used for
the current list-level) improves readability, customize the variable
~org-list-demote-modify-bullet~.  To get a greater difference of
indentation between items and theirs sub-items, customize
~org-list-indent-offset~.

#+vindex: org-list-automatic-rules
The following commands act on items when the cursor is in the first line of
an item (the line with the bullet or number).  Some of them imply the
application of automatic rules to keep list structure intact.  If some of
these actions get in your way, configure ~org-list-automatic-rules~
to disable them individually.


#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
  - {{{key(TAB)}}}, ~org-cycle~ :: 
    #+cindex: cycling, in plain lists
    #+kindex: TAB
    #+findex: org-cycle
    #+vindex: org-cycle-include-plain-lists

    Items can be folded just like headline levels.  Normally this
    works only if the cursor is on a plain list item.  For more
    details, see the variable ~org-cycle-include-plain-lists~.  If
    this variable is set to ~integrate~, plain list items will be
    treated like low-level headlines.  The level of an item is then
    given by the indentation of the bullet/number.  Items are always
    subordinate to real headlines, however; the hierarchies remain
    completely separated.  In a new item with no text yet, the first
    {{{key(TAB)}}} demotes the item to become a child of the
    previous one.  Subsequent {{{key(TAB)}}}s move the item to
    meaningful levels in the list and eventually get it back to its
    initial position.

  - {{{kbdkey(M-,RET)}}}, ~org-insert-heading~ ::

    #+findex: org-insert-heading

    Insert new item at current level.  With a prefix argument, force
    a new heading (see [[Structure editing]]).  If this command is used
    in the middle of an item, that item is /split/ in two, and the
    second part becomes the new item.[fn:19] If this command is
    executed /before item's body/, the new item is created /before/
    the current one.

  - {{{kbdkey(M-S-,RET)}}} ::

       Decrease/increase the indentation of the item, including

       current indentation.  When these commands are executed several
       times in direct succession, the initially selected region is
       used, even if the new indentation would imply a different
       hierarchy.  To use the new hierarchy, break the command chain
       with a cursor motion or so.

       #+kindex: M-S-left

       As a special case, using this command on the very first item of
       a list will move the whole list.  This behavior can be disabled
       by configuring ~org-list-automatic-rules~.  The global
       indentation of a list has no influence on the text /after/ the
       list.
  - {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} :: If there is a checkbox (see [[Checkboxes]]) in

Sometimes you want to keep information associated with an entry, but you
normally don't want to see it.  For this, Org mode has /drawers/.
Drawers need to be configured with the variable
~org-drawers~.[fn:172] Drawers
look like this:

#+begin_src org
  ,** This is a headline
     Still outside the drawer
     :DRAWERNAME:
     This is inside the drawer.
     :END:
     After the drawer.
#+end_src


You can interactively insert drawers at point by calling
~org-insert-drawer~, which is bound to {{{kbd(C-c C-x d)}}}.
With an active region, this command will put the region inside the
drawer.  With a prefix argument, this command calls
~org-insert-property-drawer~ and add a property drawer right
below the current headline.  Completion over drawer keywords is also
possible using {{{key(M-TAB)}}}.

Visibility cycling (see [[Visibility cycling]]) on the headline
will hide and show the entry, but keep the drawer collapsed to a
single line.  In order to look inside the drawer, you need to move the
cursor to the drawer line and press {{{key(TAB)}}} there.  Org mode
uses the ~PROPERTIES~ drawer for storing properties
(see [[Properties and columns]]), and you can also arrange for
state change notes (see [[Tracking TODO state changes]) and
clock times (see [[Clocking work time]) to be stored in a drawer
~LOGBOOK~.  If you want to store a quick note in the LOGBOOK
drawer, in a similar way to state changes, use

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
 - {{{kbd(C-c C-z)}}} :: Add a time-stamped note to the LOGBOOK
      drawer.

      #+kindex: C-c C-z

** Blocks
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Folding blocks
   :END:
#+vindex: org-hide-block-startup
#+cindex: blocks, folding

Org mode uses ~begin~ ...  ~end~ blocks for various purposes from including
source code examples (see [[Literal examples]]) to capturing time logging
information (see [[Clocking work time]]).  These blocks can be folded
and unfolded by pressing TAB in the begin line.  You can also get all
blocks folded at startup by configuring the variable
~org-hide-block-startup~ or on a per-file basis by using

#+cindex: @code{hideblocks}, STARTUP keyword
#+cindex: @code{nohideblocks}, STARTUP keyword
#+begin_src org
  ,#+STARTUP: hideblocks
  ,#+STARTUP: nohideblocks
#+end_src

** Creating footnotes
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Define footnotes in Org syntax
   :END:
#+cindex: footnotes

Org mode supports the creation of footnotes.  In contrast to the
{{{file(footnote.el)}}} package, Org mode's footnotes are designed for
work on a larger document, not only for one-off documents like emails.
The basic syntax is similar to the one used by
{{{file(footnote.el)}}}, i.e., a footnote is defined in a paragraph
that is started by a footnote marker in square brackets in column 0,
no indentation allowed.  If you need a paragraph break inside a
footnote, use the LaTeX idiom ~\par~.  The footnote reference is simply
the marker in square brackets, inside text.  For example:

#+begin_example
   The Org homepage[fn:1] now looks a lot better than it used to.
   ...
   [fn:1] The link is: https://orgmode.org
#+end_example

Org mode extends the number-based syntax to /named/ footnotes and
optional inline definition.  Using plain numbers as markers (as
{{{file(footnote.el)}}} does) is supported for backward compatibility,
but not encouraged because of possible conflicts with LaTeX
snippets (see [[Embedded LaTeX]]).  Here are
the valid references:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
  - ~[1]~ :: A plain numeric footnote marker.  Compatible with
           {{{file(footnote.el)}}}, but not recommended because
           something like ~[1]~ could easily be part of a
           code snippet.

  - ~[fn:name]~ :: A named footnote reference, where ~name~ is
                 a unique label word, or, for simplicity of automatic
                 creation, a number.
  - ~[fn:: This is the inline definition of this footnote]~ :: A
       LaTeX-like anonymous footnote where the definition
       is given directly at the reference point.
  - ~[fn:name: a definition]~ :: An inline definition of a footnote,
       which also specifies a name for the note.  Since Org allows
       multiple references to the same note, you can then use
       ~[fn:name]~ to create additional references.


#+vindex: org-footnote-auto-label
Footnote labels can be created automatically, or you can create names
yourself.  This is handled by the variable
~org-footnote-auto-label~ and its corresponding
~#+STARTUP~ keywords.  See the docstring of that variable for
details.

{{{noindent}}} The following command handles footnotes:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
  - {{{kbd(C-c C-x f)}}} :: The footnote action command.
                 #+kindex: C-c C-x f

                 When the cursor is on a footnote reference, jump to the
                 definition.  When it is at a definition, jump to the
                 (first) reference.

                 #+vindex: org-footnote-define-inline
                 #+vindex: org-footnote-section
                 #+vindex: org-footnote-auto-adjust

                 Otherwise, create a new footnote.  Depending on the
                 variable ~org-footnote-define-inline~, the
                 definition will be placed right into the text as part
                 of the reference, or separately into the location
                 determined by the variable ~org-footnote-section~.[fn:173]

                 When this command is called with a prefix argument, a
                 menu of additional options is offered:

    - {{{kbd(s)}}} ::  Sort the footnote definitions by reference sequence.
            During editing, Org makes no effort to sort footnote
            definitions into a particular sequence.  If you want them
            sorted, use this command, which will also move entries
            according to ~org-footnote-section~.  Automatic sorting
            after each insertion/deletion can be configured using the
            variable ~org-footnote-auto-adjust~.
    - {{{kbd(r)}}} ::  Renumber the simple ~fn:N~ footnotes.  Automatic
            renumbering after each insertion/deletion can be
            configured using the variable ~org-footnote-auto-adjust~.
    - {{{kbd(S)}}} ::  Short for first ~r~, then ~s~ action.
    - {{{kbd(n)}}} ::  Normalize the footnotes by collecting all definitions
            (including inline definitions) into a special section, and
            then numbering them in sequence.  The references will then
            also be numbers.  This is meant to be the final step
            before finishing a document (e.g., sending off an email).
            The exporters do this automatically, and so could
            something like ~message-send-hook~.
    - {{{kbd(d)}}} ::  Delete the footnote at point, and all definitions of and
            references to it.

    Depending on the variable ~org-footnote-auto-adjust~, renumbering
       and sorting footnotes can be automatic after each insertion or
       deletion.[fn:174]

  - {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} :: If the cursor is on a footnote reference, jump to the
               definition.  If it is a the definition, jump back to
               the reference.  When called at a footnote location with
               a prefix argument, offer the same menu as {{{kbd(C-c C-x f)}}}.

    #+kindex: C-c C-c

  - {{{kbd(C-c C-o)}}} or {{{kbd(mouse-1/2)}}} :: Footnote labels are also
       links to the corresponding definition/reference, and you can
       use the usual commands to follow these links.

** Orgstruct mode 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Structure editing outside Org
   :ALT_TITLE: Orgstruct mode
   :END:
#+cindex: Orgstruct mode
#+cindex: minor mode for structure editing

If you like the intuitive way the Org mode structure editing and list
formatting works, you might want to use these commands in other modes
like Text mode or Mail mode as well.  The minor mode ~orgstruct-mode~
makes this possible.  Toggle the mode with {{{kbd(M-x orgstruct-mode)}}}, or turn it on by default, for example in Message
mode, with one of:

#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'message-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgstruct)
  (add-hook 'message-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgstruct++)
#+end_src

When this mode is active and the cursor is on a line that looks to Org
like a headline or the first line of a list item, most structure
editing commands will work, even if the same keys normally have
different functionality in the major mode you are using.  If the
cursor is not in one of those special lines, Orgstruct mode lurks
silently in the shadows.  When you use ~orgstruct++-mode~, Org will
also export indentation and autofill settings into that mode, and
detect item context after the first line of an item.

* Tables
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: Pure magic for quick formatting
  :END:
#+cindex: tables
#+cindex: editing tables

Org comes with a fast and intuitive table editor.  Spreadsheet-like
calculations are supported using the Emacs {{{file(calc)}}} package
([[info:calc]]).

** Built-in table editor 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Simple tables
   :END:
#+cindex: table editor, built-in

Org makes it easy to format tables in plain ASCII.  Any line with
{{{samp(|)}}} as the first non-whitespace character is considered part
of a table.  {{{samp(|)}}} is also the column separator.[fn:22] A table
might look like this:

#+begin_src org
  | Name  | Phone | Age |
  |-------+-------+-----|
  | Peter |  1234 |  17 |
  | Anna  |  4321 |  25 |
#+end_src


A table is re-aligned automatically each time you press {{{key(TAB)}}}
or {{{key(RET)}}} or {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} inside the table.
{{{key(TAB)}}} also moves to the next field ({{{key(RET)}}} to the
next row) and creates new table rows at the end of the table or before
horizontal lines.  The indentation of the table is set by the first
line.  Any line starting with {{{samp(|-)}}} is considered as a
horizontal separator line and will be expanded on the next re-align to
span the whole table width.  So, to create the above table, you would
only type

#+begin_src org
  |Name|Phone|Age|
  |-
#+end_src


{{{noindent}}} and then press {{{key(TAB)}}} to align the table and
start filling in fields.  Even faster would be to type
~|Name|Phone|Age~ followed by {{{kbdspckey(C-c,RET)}}}.

#+vindex: org-enable-table-editor
#+vindex: org-table-auto-blank-field

When typing text into a field, Org treats {{{key(DEL)}}},
{{{key(Backspace)}}}, and all character keys in a special way, so that
inserting and deleting avoids shifting other fields.  Also, when
typing /immediately/ after the cursor was moved into a new field with
{{{key(TAB)}}}, {{{kbdkey(S-,TAB)}}} or {{{key(RET)}}}, the field is
automatically made blank.  If this behavior is too unpredictable for
you, configure the variables ~org-enable-table-editor~ and
~org-table-auto-blank-field~.

    :END:
#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c |)}}}, ~org-table-create-or-convert-from-region~ :: Convert
     the active region to table.  If every line contains at least one
     {{{key(TAB)}}} character, the function assumes that the material
     is tab separated.  If every line contains a comma, comma-separated
     values (CSV) are assumed.  If not, lines are split at whitespace
     into fields.  You can use a prefix argument to force a specific
     separator: {{{kbd(C-u)}}} forces CSV, {{{kbd(C-u C-u)}}} forces
     {{{key(TAB)}}}, and a numeric argument ~N~ indicates that at
     least N consecutive spaces, or alternatively a {{{key(TAB)}}}
     will be the separator.  If there is no active region, this command
     creates an empty Org table.  But it is easier just to start
     typing, like {{{kbdspckey(|Name|Phone|Age,RET)}}} {{{kbdkey(|-
     ,TAB)}}}.

#+cindex: narrow columns in tables
#+cindex: alignment in tables

The width of columns is automatically determined by the table editor.
And also the alignment of a column is determined automatically from
the fraction of number-like versus non-number fields in the column.

Sometimes a single field or a few fields need to carry more text,
leading to inconveniently wide columns.  Or maybe you want to make a
table with several columns having a fixed width, regardless of
content.  To set the width of a column, one field anywhere in the
column may contain just the string ~<N>~ where ~N~
is an integer specifying the width of the column in characters.[fn:23]
The next re-align will then set the width of this column to this
value.

{{{noindent}}} Fields that are wider become clipped and end in the
string {{{samp(=>)}}}.  Note that the full text is still in the buffer
but is hidden.  To see the full text, hold the mouse over the
field---a tool-tip window will show the full content.  To edit such a
field, use the command {{{kbd(C-c `)}}} (that is {{{kbd(C-c)}}}
followed by the backquote).  This will open a new window with the full
field.  Edit it and finish with {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}}.

#+vindex: org-startup-align-all-tables

When visiting a file containing a table with narrowed columns, the
necessary character hiding has not yet happened, and the table needs
to be aligned before it looks nice.  Setting the option
~org-startup-align-all-tables~ will realign all tables in a file upon
visiting, but also slow down startup.  You can also set this option on
a per-file basis with:

#+begin_src org
  ,#+STARTUP: align
  ,#+STARTUP: noalign
#+end_src

If you would like to overrule the automatic alignment of number-rich
columns to the right and of string-rich columns to the left, you can
use ~<r>~, ~<c>~ or ~<l>~ in a similar fashion.[fn:24] You may also
combine alignment and field width like this: ~<l10>~.

A line that only contains these formatting cookies will be removed
automatically when exporting the document.

** Column groups
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Grouping to trigger vertical lines
   :END:
#+cindex: grouping columns in tables

When Org exports tables, it does so by default without vertical lines
because that is visually more satisfying in general.  Occasionally
however, vertical lines can be useful to structure a table into groups
of columns, much like horizontal lines can do for groups of rows.  In
order to specify column groups, you can use a special row where the
first field contains only {{{samp(/)}}}.  The further fields can either
contain ~<~ to indicate that this column should start a group,
~>~ to indicate the end of a column, or ~<>~ (no space
between ~<~ and ~>~) to make a column a group of its own.  Boundaries
between column groups will upon export be marked with vertical lines.
Here is an example:

#+begin_src org
  | N | N^2 | N^3 | N^4 | sqrt(n) | sqrt[4](N) |
  |---+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
  | / |   < |     |   > |       < |          > |
  | 1 |   1 |   1 |   1 |       1 |          1 |
  | 2 |   4 |   8 |  16 |  1.4142 |     1.1892 |
  | 3 |   9 |  27 |  81 |  1.7321 |     1.3161 |
  |---+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
  ,#+TBLFM: $2=$1^2::$3=$1^3::$4=$1^4::$5=sqrt($1)::$6=sqrt(sqrt(($1)))
#+end_src

It is also sufficient to just insert the column group starters after
every vertical line you would like to have:

#+begin_src org
  |  N | N^2 | N^3 | N^4 | sqrt(n) | sqrt[4](N) |
  |----+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
  | /  | <   |     |     | <       |            |
#+end_src

** The Orgtbl mode minor mode
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: The table editor as minor mode
   :ALT_TITLE: Ogtbl mode
   :END:
#+cindex: Orgtbl mode
#+cindex: minor mode for tables

If you like the intuitive way the Org table editor works, you might
also want to use it in other modes like Text mode or Mail mode.  The
minor mode Orgtbl mode makes this possible.  You can always toggle the
mode with {{{kbd(M-x orgtbl-mode)}}}.  To turn it on by default, for
example in Message mode, use

#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'message-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgtbl)
#+end_src

Furthermore, with some special setup, it is possible to maintain
tables in arbitrary syntax with Orgtbl mode.  For example, it is
possible to construct LaTeX tables with the underlying ease and
power of Orgtbl mode, including spreadsheet capabilities.  For
details, see [[Tables in arbitrary syntax]].

** The spreadsheet
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: The table editor has spreadsheet capabilities
   :END:
#+cindex: calculations, in tables
#+cindex: spreadsheet capabilities
#+cindex: @file{calc} package

The table editor makes use of the Emacs {{{file(calc)}}} package to
implement spreadsheet-like capabilities.  It can also evaluate Emacs
Lisp forms to derive fields from other fields.  While fully featured,
Org's implementation is not identical to other spreadsheets.  For
example, Org knows the concept of a /column formula/ that will be
applied to all non-header fields in a column without having to copy
the formula to each relevant field.  There is also a formula debugger,
and a formula editor with features for highlighting fields in the
table corresponding to the references at the point in the formula,
moving these references by arrow keys

*** References
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How to refer to another field or range
    :END:
#+cindex: references

To compute fields in the table from other fields, formulas must
reference other fields or ranges.  In Org, fields can be referenced by
name, by absolute coordinates, and by relative coordinates.  To find
out what the coordinates of a field are, press {{{kbd(C-c ?)}}} in
that field, or press {{{kbd(C-c })}}} to toggle the display of a
grid.

**** Field references
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Refer to a particular field
     :END:
#+cindex: field references
#+cindex: references, to fields

Formulas can reference the value of another field in two ways.  Like
in any other spreadsheet, you may reference fields with a
letter/number combination like ~B3~, meaning the 2nd field in the 3rd
row.

#+vindex: org-table-use-standard-references
However, Org prefers to use another, more general representation that
looks like this:[fn:25]

#+begin_example
   @ROW$COLUMN
#+end_example

Column specifications can be absolute like ~$1~, ~$2~, ..., ~$N~, or
relative to the current column (i.e., the column of the field which is
being computed) like ~$+1~ or ~$-2~.  ~$<~ and ~$>~ are immutable
references to the first and last column, respectively, and you can use
~$>>>~ to indicate the third column from the right.

The row specification only counts data lines and ignores horizontal
separator lines (hlines).  Like with columns, you can use absolute row
numbers ~@1~, ~@2~, ..., ~@N~, and row numbers relative to the current
row like ~@+3~ or ~@-1~.  ~@<~ and ~@>~ are immutable references the
first and last row in the table, respectively.[fn:26] You may also
specify the row relative to one of the hlines: ~@I~ refers to the
first hline, ~@II~ to the second, etc.  ~@-I~ refers to the first such
line above the current line, ~@+I~ to the first such line below the
current line.  You can also write ~@III+2~ which is the second data
line after the third hline in the table.

~@0~ and ~$0~ refer to the current row and column, respectively, i.e.,
to the row/column for the field being computed.  Also, if you omit
either the column or the row part of the reference, the current
row/column is implied.

Org's references with /unsigned/ numbers are fixed references in the
sense that if you use the same reference in the formula for two
different fields, the same field will be referenced each time.  Org's
references with /signed/ numbers are floating references because the
same reference operator can reference different fields depending on
the field being calculated by the formula.

Here are a few examples:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @code
  - @2$3 :: 2nd row, 3rd column (same as ~C2~)
  - $5 :: column 5 in the current row (same as ~E&~)
  - @2 :: current column, row 2
  - @-1$-3 :: the field one row up, three columns to the left
  - @-I$2 :: field just under hline above current row, column 2
  - @>$5 :: field in the last row, in column 5

**** Range references
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Refer to a range of fields
     :END:
#+cindex: range references
#+cindex: references, to ranges

You may reference a rectangular range of fields by specifying two
field references connected by two dots ~..~.  If both fields are in
the current row, you may simply use ~$2..$7~, but if at least one
field is in a different row, you need to use the general ~@row$column~
format at least for the first field (i.e., the reference must start
with ~@~ in order to be interpreted correctly).  Examples:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @code
  - $1..$3      :: first three fields in the current row
  - $P..$Q      :: range, using column names (see under Advanced)
  - $<<<..$>>   :: start in third column, continue to the one but last
  - @2$1..@4$3  ::  six fields between these two fields (same as
                   ~A2..C4~)
  - @-1$-2..@-1 :: three numbers from the column to the left, 2 up to
                   current row
  - @I..II      ::  between first and second hline, short for ~@I..@II~


{{{noindent}}} Range references return a vector of values that can be
fed into Calc vector functions.  Empty fields in ranges are normally
suppressed, so that the vector contains only the non-empty fields (but
see the ~E~ mode switch below).  If there are no non-empty fields,
~[0]~ is returned to avoid syntax errors in formulas.

**** Field coordinates in formulas
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Refer to fields in Lisp or Calc
     :END:
#+cindex: field coordinates
#+cindex: coordinates, of field
#+cindex: row, of field coordinates
#+cindex: column, of field coordinates

For Calc formulas and Lisp formulas ~@#~ and ~$#~ can be used to get
the row or column number of the field where the formula result goes.
The traditional Lisp formula equivalents are ~org-table-current-dline~
and ~org-table-current-column~.  Examples:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @code
  - if(@# % 2, $#, string("")) :: column number on odd lines only
  - $3 = remote(FOO, @#$2)    :: copy column 2 from table FOO into
       column 3 of the current table

{{{noindent}}} For the second example, table FOO must have at least as
many rows as the current table.  Note that this is inefficient for
large number of rows.[fn:27]

**** Named references
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Name columns or constants
     :END:
#+cindex: named references
#+cindex: references, named
#+cindex: name, of column or field
#+cindex: constants, in calculations
#+cindex: #+CONSTANTS
#+vindex: org-table-formula-constants

{{{samp($name)}}} is interpreted as the name of a column, parameter or
constant.  Constants are defined globally through the variable
~org-table-formula-constants~, and locally (for the file) through a
line like this example:

#+begin_src org
  ,#+CONSTANTS: c=299792458. pi=3.14 eps=2.4e-6
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}}
#+vindex: constants-unit-system
#+pindex: constants.el

Also, properties (see [[Properties and columns]]) can be used as constants
in table formulas: for a property ~:Xyz:~ use the name ~$PROP_Xyz~,
and the property will be searched in the current outline entry and in
the hierarchy above it.  If you have the {{{file(constants.el)}}}
package, it will also be used to resolve constants, including natural
constants like ~$h~ for Planck's constant, and units like ~$km~ for
kilometers.  Column names and parameters can be specified in special
table lines.  These are described in the section, [[Advanced features]].
All names must start with a letter, and further consist of letters and
numbers.[fn:175]

**** Remote references
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Refer to information in other tables
     :END:
#+cindex: remote references
#+cindex: references, remote
#+cindex: references, to a different table
#+cindex: name, of column or field
#+cindex: constants, in calculations
#+cindex: #+TBLNAME

You may also reference constants, fields and ranges from a different
table, either in the current file or even in a different file.  The
syntax is

#+begin_example
   remote(NAME-OR-ID,REF)
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} where NAME can be the name of a table in the current
file as set by a ~#+TBLNAME: NAME~ line before the table.  It can also
be the ID of an entry, even in a different file, and the reference
then refers to the first table in that entry.  REF is an absolute field
or range reference as described above for example ~@3$3~ or
~$somename~, valid in the referenced table.

*** Formula syntax for Calc
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Using Calc to compute stuff
    :END:
#+cindex: formula syntax, Calc
#+cindex: syntax, of formulas

A formula can be any algebraic expression understood by the Emacs
{{{file(Calc)}}} package.[fn:28] Before evaluation by ~calc-eval~ (see
[[info:calc#Calling Calc from Your Programs][Calling Calc from Your Lisp Programs]]), variable substitution takes
place according to the rules described above.

#+cindex: vectors, in table calculations
The range vectors can be directly fed into the Calc vector functions
like ~vmean~ and ~vsum~.

#+cindex: format specifier
#+cindex: mode, for @file{calc}
#+vindex: org-calc-default-modes

A formula can contain an optional mode string after a semicolon.  This
string consists of flags to influence Calc and other modes during
execution.  By default, Org uses the standard Calc modes (precision
12, angular units degrees, fraction and symbolic modes off).  The
display format, however, has been changed to ~(float 8)~ to keep
tables compact.  The default settings can be configured using the
variable ~org-calc-default-modes~.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @code
  - p20 :: set the internal Calc calculation precision to 20 digits
  - n3 s3 e2 f4 :: normal, scientific, engineering, or fixed format of
                   the result of Calc passed back to Org.  Calc
                   formatting is unlimited in precision as long as the
                   Calc calculation precision is greater.
  - D R :: angle modes: degrees, radians
  - F S :: fraction and symbolic modes
  - N :: interpret all fields as numbers, use 0 for non-numbers
  - E :: keep empty fields in ranges
  - L :: literal

{{{noindent}}} Unless you use large integer numbers or
high-precision-calculation and -display for floating point numbers you
may alternatively provide a ~printf~ format specifier to reformat the
Calc result after it has been passed back to Org instead of letting
Calc already do the formatting.[fn:29] A few examples:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @code
  - $1+$2            :: Sum of first and second field
  - $1+$2;%.2f       :: Same, format result to two decimals
  - exp($2)+exp($1)  :: Math functions can be used
  - $0;%.1f          :: Reformat current cell to 1 decimal
  - ($3-32)*5/9      :: Degrees F -> C conversion
  - $c/$1/$cm        :: Hz -> cm conversion, using
       {{{file(constants.el)}}}
  - tan($1);Dp3s1    :: Compute in degrees, precision 3, display SCI 1
  - sin($1);Dp3%.1e  :: Same, but use ~printf~ specifier for display
  - vmean($2..$7)    :: Compute column range mean, using vector
       function
  - vmean($2..$7);EN :: Same, but treat empty fields as 0
  - taylor($3,x=7,2) :: Taylor series of $3, at x=7, second degree

Calc also contains a complete set of logical operations.  For example

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @code
  - if($1<20,teen,string("")) ::  "teen" if age $1 less than 20, else empty


Note that you can also use two org-specific flags ~T~ and ~t~ for
durations computations [[Duration and time values]].

You can add your own Calc functions defined in Emacs Lisp with
~defmath~ and use them in formula syntax for Calc.

*** Emacs Lisp forms as formulas
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Writing formulas in Emacs Lisp
    :ALT_TITLE: Formula syntax for Lisp
    :END:
#+cindex: Lisp forms, as table formulas

It is also possible to write a formula in Emacs Lisp.  This can be
useful for string manipulation and control structures, if Calc's
functionality is not enough.

If a formula starts with a single-quote followed by an opening
parenthesis, then it is evaluated as a Lisp form.  The evaluation
should return either a string or a number.  Just as with
{{{file(calc)}}} formulas, you can specify modes and a printf format
after a semicolon.

With Emacs Lisp forms, you need to be conscious about the way field
references are interpolated into the form.  By default, a reference
will be interpolated as a Lisp string (in double-quotes) containing
the field.  If you provide the {{{samp(N)}}} mode switch, all
referenced elements will be numbers (non-number fields will be zero)
and interpolated as Lisp numbers, without quotes.  If you provide the
{{{samp(L)}}} flag, all fields will be interpolated literally, without
quotes.  I.e., if you want a reference to be interpreted as a string by
the Lisp form, enclose the reference operator itself in double-quotes,
like ~"$3"~.  Ranges are inserted as space-separated fields, so you can
embed them in list or vector syntax.

Here are a few examples---note how the {{{samp(N)}}} mode is used when
we do computations in Lisp.

Swap the first two characters of the content of column 1:
#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  '(concat (substring $1 1 2) (substring $1 0 1) (substring $1 2))
#+end_src

Add columns 1 and 2, equivalent to Calc's ~$1+$2~:
#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  '(+ $1 $2);N
#+end_src

Compute the sum of columns 1-4, like Calc's ~vsum($1..$4)~}:
#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  '(apply '+ '($1..$4));N
#+end_src

*** Duration and time values
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How to compute duration and time values
    :END:
#+cindex: Duration, computing
#+cindex: Time, computing
#+vindex: org-table-duration-custom-format

If you want to compute time values use the ~T~ flag, either in Calc
formulas or Elisp formulas:

#+begin_example
   |  Task 1 |   Task 2 |    Total |
   |---------+----------+----------|
   |    2:12 |     1:47 | 03:59:00 |
   | 3:02:20 | -2:07:00 |     0.92 |
   #+TBLFM: @2$3=$1+$2;T::@3$3=$1+$2;t
#+end_example

Input duration values must be of the form ~[HH:MM[:SS]~, where seconds
are optional.  With the ~T~ flag, computed durations will be displayed
as ~HH:MM:SS~ (see the first formula above).  With the ~t~ flag,
computed durations will be displayed according to the value of the
variable ~org-table-duration-custom-format~, which defaults to
~'hours~ and will display the result as a fraction of hours (see the
second formula in the example above).

Negative duration values can be manipulated as well, and integers will
be considered as seconds in addition and subtraction.

*** Field and range formulas
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Formulas for specific (ranges of) fields
    :END:
#+cindex: field formula
#+cindex: range formula
#+cindex: formula, for individual table field
#+cindex: formula, for range of fields

To assign a formula to a particular field, type it directly into the
field, preceded by ~:=~, for example ~vsum(@II..III)~.  When you press
{{{key(TAB)}}} or {{{key(RET)}}} or {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} with the cursor
still in the field, the formula will be stored as the formula for this
field, evaluated, and the current field will be replaced with the
result.

#+cindex: #+TBLFM
Formulas are stored in a special line starting with ~#+TBLFM:~
directly below the table.  If you type the equation in the fourth field
of the third data line in the table, the formula will look like
~@3$4=$1+$2~.  When inserting/deleting/swapping column and rows with
the appropriate commands, /absolute references/ (but not relative
ones) in stored formulas are modified in order to still reference the
same field.  To avoid this from happening, in particular in range
references, anchor ranges at the table borders (using ~@<~, ~@>~,
~$<~, ~$>~), or at hlines using the ~@I~ notation.  Automatic
adaptation of field references does of course not happen if you edit
the table structure with normal editing commands---then you must fix
the equations yourself.

Instead of typing an equation into the field, you may also use the
following command

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
  - {{{kbd(C-u C-c =)}}}, ~org-table-eval-formula~ :: Install a new
       formula for the current field.  The command prompts for a
       formula with default taken from the {{{samp(#+TBLFM:)}}} line,
       applies it to the current field, and stores it.

       #+kindex: C-u C-c =
       #+findex: org-table-eval-formula
The left-hand side of a formula can also be a special expression in
order to assign the formula to a number of different fields.  There is
no keyboard shortcut to enter such range formulas.  To add them, use
the formula editor (see [[Editing and debugging formulas]]) or edit the
~#+TBLFM:~ line directly.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @code
  - $2= :: Column formula, valid for the entire column.  This is so
           common that Org treats these formulas in a special way, see
           [[Column formulas]].
  - @3= :: Row formula, applies to all fields in the specified row.
            ~@@>=~ means the last row.
  - @1$2..@4$3= :: Range formula, applies to all fields in the given
                     rectangular range.  This can also be used to
                     assign a formula to some but not all fields in a
                     row.
  - $name= :: Named field, see [[Advanced features]].

*** Column formulas
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Formulas valid for an entire column
    :END:
#+cindex: column formula
#+cindex: formula, for table column

When you assign a formula to a simple column reference like ~$3=~, the
same formula will be used in all fields of that column, with the
following very convenient exceptions:

  -  If the table contains horizontal separator hlines with rows above
     and below, everything before the first such hline is considered
     part of the table /header/ and will not be modified by column
     formulas.  Therefore a header is mandatory when you use column
     formulas and want to add hlines to group rows, like for example
     to separate a total row at the bottom from the summand rows
     above.

  -  Fields that already get a value from a field/range formula will
     be left alone by column formulas.  These conditions make column
     formulas very easy to use.

To assign a formula to a column, type it directly into any field in
the column, preceded by an equal sign, like {{{samp(=$1+$2)}}}.  When
you press {{{key(TAB)}}} or {{{key(RET)}}} or {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} with
the cursor still in the field, the formula will be stored as the
formula for the current column, evaluated and the current field
replaced with the result.  If the field contains only {{{samp(=)}}},
the previously stored formula for this column is used.  For each
column, Org will only remember the most recently used formula.  In the
{{{samp(#+TBLFM:)}}} line, column formulas will look like
{{{samp($4=$1+$2)}}}.  The left-hand side of a column formula can not
be the name of column, it must be the numeric column reference or
~$>~.

Instead of typing an equation into the field, you may also use the
following command:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
  - {{{kbd(C-c =)}}}, ~org-table-eval-formula~ :: Install a new formula
       for the current column and replace current field with the
       result of the formula.  The command prompts for a formula, with
       default taken from the {{{samp(#+TBLFM)}}} line, applies it to
       the current field and stores it.  With a numeric prefix
       argument(e.g., {{{kbd(C-5 C-c =)}}}) the command will apply it
       to that many consecutive fields in the current column.

       same order as the correspoding parameters are in the call to
       ~org-lookup-first~, where ~VAL~ precedes ~S-LIST~.  If ~R-LIST~
       is ~nil~, the matching element ~S~ of ~S-LIST~ is returned.
  - (org-lookup-last VAL S-LIST R-LIST &optional PREDICATE) :: Similar
       to ~org-lookup-first~ above, but searches for the /last/
       element for which ~PREDICATE~ is ~t~.

       #+findex: org-lookup-last
  - (org-lookup-all VAL S-LIST R-LIST &optional PREDICATE) :: Similar
       to ~org-lookup-first~, but searches for /all/ elements for
       which ~PREDICATE~ is ~t~, and returns /all/ corresponding
       values.  This function can not be used by itself in a formula,
       because it returns a list of values.  However, powerful lookups
       can be built when this function is combined with other Emacs
       Lisp functions.

       #+findex: org-lookup-all

If the ranges used in these functions contain empty fields, the ~E~
mode for the formula should usually be specified: otherwise empty
fields will not be included in ~S-LIST~ and/or ~R-LIST~ which can, for
example, result in an incorrect mapping from an element of ~S-LIST~ to
the corresponding element of ~R-LIST~.

These three functions can be used to implement associative arrays,
count matching cells, rank results, group data, etc.  For practical
examples see [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-lookups.html][this tutorial on Worg]].

#+cindex: editing, of table formulas

#+vindex: org-table-use-standard-references You can edit
individual formulas in the minibuffer or directly in the field.  Org
can also prepare a special buffer with all active formulas of a table.
When offering a formula for editing, Org converts references to the
standard format (like ~B3~ or ~D&~) if possible.  If you prefer to
only work with the internal format (like ~@3$2~ or ~$4~), configure
the variable ~org-table-use-standard-references~.

       formula, format the formula according to Emacs Lisp rules.
       Another {{{key(TAB)}}} collapses the formula back again.  In

Making a table field blank does not remove the formula associated with
the field, because that is stored in a different line (the
{{{samp(#+TBLFM)}}} line)---during the next recalculation the field
will be filled again.  To remove a formula from a field, you have to
give an empty reply when prompted for the formula, or to edit the
{{{samp(#+TBLFM)}}} line.

#+kindex: C-c C-c
You may edit the {{{samp(#+TBLFM)}}} directly and re-apply the changed

Recalculation of a table is normally not automatic, but needs to be
triggered by a command.  See [[Advanced features]], for a way to make
recalculation at least semi-automatic.

In order to recalculate a line of a table or the entire table, use the
following commands:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
  - {{{kbd(C-c *)}}}, ~org-table-recalculate~ :: Recalculate the
       current row by first applying the stored column formulas from
       left to right, and all field/range formulas in the current row.

       #+kindex: C-c *
       #+findex: org-table-recalculate
  - {{{kbd(C-u C-c *)}}} or {{{kbd(C-u C-c C-c)}}} :: Recompute the
       entire table, line by line.  Any lines before the first hline
       are left alone, assuming that these are part of the table
       header.

       #+kindex: C-u C-c *
       #+kindex: C-u C-c C-c
  - {{{kbd(C-u C-u C-c *)}}} or {{{kbd(C-u C-u C-c C-c)}}}, ~org-table-iterate~ ::
       
       Iterate the table by recomputing it until no further changes
       occur.  This may be necessary if some computed fields use the
       value of other fields that are computed /later/ in the
       calculation sequence.

If you want the recalculation of fields to happen automatically, or if

you need to reserve the first column of the table for special marking
characters.[fn:30]

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
  - {{{kbd(C-#)}}}, ~org-table-rotate-recalc-marks~ :: Rotate the
       calculation mark in first column through the states {{{samp( )}}}, {{{samp(#)}}}, {{{samp(*)}}}, {{{samp(!)}}},

  ,#+TBLFM: $6=vsum($P1..$P3)::$7=10*$Tot/$max;%.1f::$at=vmean(@-II..@-I);%.1f
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} Important: please note that for these special tables,
recalculating the table with {{{kbd(C-u C-c *)}}} will only affect
rows that are marked ~#~ or ~*~, and fields that
have a formula assigned to the field itself.  The column formulas are
not applied in rows with empty first field.

#+cindex: marking characters, tables
The marking characters have the following meaning:
#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @samp
  - ! :: The fields in this line define names for the columns, so that
         you may refer to a column as {{{samp($Tot)}}} instead of
         {{{samp($6)}}}.
  - ^ :: This row defines names for the fields @emph{above} the row.
         With such a definition, any formula in the table may use
         {{{samp($m1)}}} to refer to the value {{{samp(10)}}}.  Also,
         if you assign a formula to a names field, it will be stored
         as ~$name= ...~.
  - _ :: Similar to {{{samp(^)}}}, but defines names for the fields in
         the row /below/.
  - $ :: Fields in this row can define /parameters/ for formulas.  For
         example, if a field in a {{{samp($)}}} row contains
         {{{samp(max=50)}}}, then formulas in this table can refer to
         the value 50 using {{{samp($max)}}}.  Parameters work exactly
         like constants, only that they can be defined on a per-table
         basis.
  - # :: Fields in this row are automatically recalculated when
         pressing {{{key(TAB)}}} or {{{key(RET)}}} or
         {{{kbdkey(S-,TAB)}}} in this row.  Also, this row is selected
         for a global recalculation with {{{kbd(C-u C-c *)}}}.
         Unmarked lines will be left alone by this command.
  - * :: Selects this line for global recalculation with {{{kbd(C-u C-c *)}}}, but not for automatic recalculation.  Use this
         when automatic recalculation slows down editing too much.
  - \nbsp :: Unmarked lines are exempt from recalculation with {{{kbd(C-u C-c *)}}}.  All lines that should be recalculated should be
       marked with ~#~ or ~*~.
  - / :: Do not export this line.  Useful for lines that contain the
         narrowing ~<N>~ markers or column group markers.


Finally, just to whet your appetite for what can be done with the

Org-Plot can produce 2D and 3D graphs of information stored in org
tables using [[http://www.gnuplot.info/][Gnuplot]] and [[http://cars9.uchicago.edu/~ravel/software/gnuplot-mode.html][gnuplot-mode]].  To see this in action, ensure
that you have both Gnuplot and Gnuplot-mode installed on your system,
then call ~org-plot/gnuplot~ on the following table.

#+begin_src org

#+end_src

Notice that Org Plot is smart enough to apply the table's headers as
labels.  Further control over the labels, type, content, and appearance
of plots can be exercised through the ~#+PLOT:~ lines preceding a
table.  See below for a complete list of Org-plot options.  For more
information and examples see the [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-plot.html][Org-plot tutorial]].

Org-Plot recognizes the following options:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @code
  - set :: Specify any {{{command(gnuplot)}}} option to be set when
           graphing.
  - title :: Specify the title of the plot.
  - ind :: Specify which column of the table to use as the ~x~ axis.
  - deps :: Specify the columns to graph as a Lisp style list,
            surrounded by parentheses and separated by spaces for
            example ~dep:(3 4)~ to graph the third and fourth columns
            (defaults to graphing all other columns aside from the
            ~ind~ column).
  - type :: Specify whether the plot will be ~2d~, ~3d~, or ~grid~.
  - with :: Specify a ~with~ option to be inserted for every col being
            plotted (e.g., ~lines~, ~points~, ~boxes~, ~impulses~,
            etc.).  Defaults to ~lines~.
  - file :: If you want to plot to a file, specify
            ~"{path/to/desired/output-file}"~.
  - labels :: List of labels to be used for the ~deps~ (defaults to
              the column headers if they exist).
  - line :: Specify an entire line to be inserted in the Gnuplot
            script.
  - map :: When plotting ~3d~ or ~grid~ types, set this to ~t~ to
           graph a flat mapping rather than a ~3d~ slope.
  - timefmt ::  Specify format of Org mode timestamps as they will be
                parsed by Gnuplot.  Defaults to
                {{{samp(%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S)}}}.
  - script :: If you want total control, you can specify a script file
              (place the file name between double-quotes) which will
              be used to plot.  Before plotting, every instance of
              ~$datafile~ in the specified script will be replaced
              with the path to the generated data file.  Note: even if
              you set this option, you may still want to specify the
              plot type, as that can impact the content of the data
              file.

* Hyperlinks
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: Notes in context
  :ORDERED:  t
  :END:
#+cindex: hyperlinks

Like HTML, Org provides links inside a file, external links to
other files, Usenet articles, emails, and much more.

** Link format
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: How links in Org are formatted
   :END:
#+cindex: link format
#+cindex: format, of links

Org will recognize plain URL-like links and activate them as clickable
links.  The general link format, however, looks like this:

#+begin_src org
  [[link][description]] or  [[link]]
#+end_src


{{{noindent}}} Once a link in the buffer is complete (all brackets
present), Org will change the display so that {{{samp(description)}}}
is displayed instead of ~[[link][description]]~ and {{{samp(link)}}}
is displayed instead of ~[[link]]~.  Links will be highlighted
in the face ~org-link~, which by default is an underlined face.  You
can directly edit the visible part of a link.  Note that this can be
either the {{{samp(link)}}} part (if there is no description) or the
{{{samp(description)}}} part.  To edit also the invisible
{{{samp(link)}}} part, use {{{kbd(C-c C-l)}}} with the cursor on the
link.

If you place the cursor at the beginning or just behind the end of the
displayed text and press {{{key(BACKSPACE)}}}, you will remove the
(invisible) bracket at that location.  This makes the link incomplete
and the internals are again displayed as plain text.  Inserting the
missing bracket hides the link internals again.  To show the internal
structure of all links, use the menu entry ~Org->Hyperlinks->Literal
links~.

** Internal links
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Links to other places in the current file
   :END:
#+cindex: internal links
#+cindex: links, internal
#+cindex: targets, for links
#+cindex: property, CUSTOM_ID

If the link does not look like a URL, it is considered to be internal
in the current file.  The most important case is a link like
~[[#my-custom-id]]~ which will link to the entry with the
~CUSTOM_ID~ property {{{samp(my-custom-id)}}}.  Such custom IDs are
very good for HTML export (see [[HTML export]]) where they produce pretty
section links.  You are responsible yourself to make sure these custom
IDs are unique in a file.

Links such as the two in the following example:

#+begin_example
   [[My Target]] or [[My Target][Find my target]]
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} lead to a text search in the current file.

The link can be followed with {{{kbd(C-c C-o)}}} when the cursor is on
the link, or with a mouse click (see [[Handling links]]).  Links to custom
IDs will point to the corresponding headline.  The preferred match for
a text link is a /dedicated target/: the same string in double angular
brackets.  Targets may be located anywhere; sometimes it is convenient
to put them into a comment line.  For example

#+begin_src org
  # <<My Target>>
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} In HTML export (see [[HTML export]]), such targets will
become named anchors for direct access through {{{samp(http)}}}
links.[fn:31]

If no dedicated target exists, Org will search for a headline that is
exactly the link text but may also include a TODO keyword and
tags.[fn:32] In non-Org files, the search will look for the words in
the link text.  In the above example the search would be for ~my target~.

Following a link pushes a mark onto Org's own mark ring.  You can
return to the previous position with {{{kbd(C-c &)}}}.  Using this

recorded earlier.

** Radio targets
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Automatically create internal links
    :END:
#+cindex: radio targets
#+cindex: targets, radio
#+cindex: links, radio targets

Org can automatically turn any occurrences of certain target names in
normal text into a link.  So without explicitly creating a link, the
text connects to the target radioing its position.  Radio targets are
enclosed by triple angular brackets.  For example, a target
~<<<My Target>>>~ causes each occurrence of ~my target~ in
normal text to become activated as a link.  The Org file is scanned
automatically for radio targets only when the file is first loaded
into Emacs.  To update the target list during editing, press 
{{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} with the cursor on or at a target.

Org supports links to files, websites, Usenet and email messages, BBDB
database entries and links to both IRC conversations and their logs.
External links are URL-like locators.  They start with a short
identifying string followed by a colon.  There can be no space after
the colon.  The following list shows examples for each link type.

For customizing Org to add new link types [[Adding hyperlink types]].

A link should be enclosed in double brackets and may contain a
descriptive text to be displayed instead of the URL (see [[Link format]]),
for example:

#+begin_src org
  [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]]
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} If the description is a file name or URL that points to
an image, HTML export (see [[HTML export]]) will inline the image as a
clickable button.  If there is no description at all and the link
points to an image, that image will be inlined into the exported HTML
file.

#+cindex: square brackets, around links
#+cindex: plain text external links

Org also finds external links in the normal text and activates them as
links.  If spaces must be part of the link (for example in
{{{samp(bbdb:Richard Stallman)}}}), or if you need to remove
ambiguities about the end of the link, enclose them in square
brackets.

** Handling links
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: URL-like links to the world
   :END:
#+cindex: links, handling

Org provides methods to create a link in the correct syntax, to
insert it into an Org file, and to follow the link.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
  - {{{kbd(C-c l)}}}, ~org-store-link~ :: Store a link to the current
       location.  This is a /global/ command (you must create the key
       binding yourself) which can be used in any buffer to create a
       link.  The link will be stored for later insertion into an Org
       buffer (see below).  What kind of link will be created depends
       on the current buffer:

       #+cindex: storing links
       #+kindex: C-c l
       #+findex: org-store-link
    - Org mode buffers :: For Org files, if there is a
         ~<<target>>~ at the cursor, the link points to the
         target.  Otherwise it points to the current headline, which
         will also be the description.[fn:34]

         #+vindex: org-link-to-org-use-id
         #+cindex: property, CUSTOM_ID
         #+cindex: property, ID

         If the headline has a ~CUSTOM_ID~ property, a link to this
         custom ID will be stored.  In addition or alternatively
         (depending on the value of ~org-link-to-org-use-id~), a
         globally unique ~ID~ property will be created and/or used to
         construct a link.[fn:176]  So using this command in Org buffers will
         potentially create two links: a human-readable link from the
         custom ID, and one that is globally unique and works even if
         the entry is moved from file to file.  Later, when inserting
         the link, you need to decide which one to use.

    - Email/News clients: VM, Rmail, Wanderlust, MH-E, Gnus :: Pretty
         much all Emacs mail clients are supported.  The link will
         point to the current article, or, in some GNUS buffers, to
         the group.  The description is constructed from the author
         and the subject.

    - Web browsers: W3 and W3M :: Here the link will be the current
         URL, with the page title as description.

    - Contacts: BBDB :: Links created in a BBDB buffer will point to
                        the current entry.
    - Chat: IRC :: For IRC links, if you set the variable
                   ~org-irc-link-to-logs~ to ~t~, a ~file:~
                   style link to the relevant point in the logs for
                   the current conversation is created.  Otherwise an
                   ~irc:/~ style link to the
                   user/channel/server under the point will be stored.

                   #+vindex: org-irc-link-to-logs
                   
    - Other files :: For any other files, the link will point to the
                     file, with a search string (see [[Search options]])
                     pointing to the contents of the current line.  If
                     there is an active region, the selected words
                     will form the basis of the search string.  If the
                     automatically created link is not working
                     correctly or accurately enough, you can write
                     custom functions to select the search string and
                     to do the search for particular file types---see
                     [[Custom searches]].  The key binding {{{kbd(C-c l)}}}
                     is only a suggestion---see [[Installation]].

    - Agenda view :: When the cursor is in an agenda view, the created
                     link points to the entry referenced by the
                     current line.

  - {{{kbd(C-c C-l)}}}, ~org-insert-link~ :: Insert a link.[fn:35] This
       prompts for a link to be inserted into the buffer.  You can just
       type a link, using text for an internal link, or one of the
       link type prefixes mentioned in the examples above.  The link
       will be inserted into the buffer, along with a
       descriptive text.[fn:36] If some text was selected when this command
       is called, the selected text becomes the default description.

       #+cindex: link completion
       #+cindex: completion, of links
       #+cindex: inserting links
       #+vindex: org-keep-stored-link-after-insertion
       #+kindex: C-c C-l
       #+findex: org-insert-link
    - Inserting stored links :: All links stored during the current
         session are part of the history for this prompt, so you can
         access them with {{{key(up)}}} and {{{key(down)}}} (or
         {{{kbd(M-p/n)}}}).

    - Completion support :: Completion with {{{key(TAB)}}} will help
         you to insert valid link prefixes like ~http:~ or
         ~ftp:~, including the prefixes defined through link
         abbreviations (see [[Link abbreviations]]).  If you press
         {{{key(RET)}}} after inserting only the
         {{{var(prefix)}}}, Org will offer specific completion
         support for some link types.[fn:37] For example, if you type
         {{{kbdspckey(file,RET)}}}, file name completion (alternative
         access: {{{kbd(C-u C-c C-l)}}}, see below) will be offered,
         and after {{{kbdspckey(bbdb,RET)}}} you can complete contact
         names.

  - {{{kbd(C-u C-c C-l)}}} :: When {{{kbd(C-c C-l)}}} is called with a
       {{{kbd(C-u)}}} prefix argument, a link to a file will be
       inserted and you may use file name completion to select the
       name of the file.  The path to the file is inserted relative to
       the directory of the current Org file, if the linked file is in
       the current directory or in a sub-directory of it, or if the
       path is written relative to the current directory using
       {{{samp(../)}}}.  Otherwise an absolute path is used, if
       possible with {{{samp(~/)}}} for your home directory.  You can
       force an absolute path with two {{{kbd(C-u)}}} prefixes.

       #+cindex: file name completion
       #+cindex: completion, of file names
       #+kindex: C-u C-c C-l

  - {{{kbd(C-c C-l)}}} (with cursor on existing link) :: When the
       cursor is on an existing link, {{{kbd(C-c C-l)}}} allows you to
       edit the link and description parts of the link.

       #+cindex: following links

    - {{{kbd(C-c C-o)}}}, ~org-open-at-point~ :: Open link at
         point.  This will launch a web browser for URLs (using
         {{{command(browse-url-at-point)}}}), run
         VM/MH-E/Wanderlust/Rmail/Gnus/BBDB for the corresponding
         links, and execute the command in a shell link.  When the
         cursor is on an internal link, this command runs the
         corresponding search.  When the cursor is on a TAG list in a
         headline, it creates the corresponding TAGS view.  If the
         cursor is on a timestamp, it compiles the agenda for that
         date.  Furthermore, it will visit text and remote files in
         ~file:~ links with Emacs and select a suitable
         application for local non-text files.  Classification of files
         is based on file extension only.  See option ~org-file-apps~.
         If you want to override the default application and visit the
         file with Emacs, use a {{{kbd(C-u)}}} prefix.  If you want to
         avoid opening in Emacs, use a {{{kbd(C-u C-u)}}} prefix.  If
         the cursor is on a headline, but not on a link, offer all
         links in the headline and entry text.  If you want to setup
         the frame configuration for following links, customize
         ~org-link-frame-setup~.

         #+vindex: org-file-apps
         #+vindex: org-link-frame-setup
         #+kindex: C-c C-o
         #+findex: org-open-at-point
    - {{{key(RET)}}} :: When ~org-return-follows-link~ is set,
                        {{{key(RET)}}} will also follow the link at
                        point.

                        #+vindex: org-return-follows-link
                        #+kindex: RET
    - {{{key(mouse-2)}}} or {{{key(mouse-1)}}} :: On links,
         {{{kbd(mouse-2)}}} will open the link just as {{{kbd(C-c C-o)}}} would.  Under Emacs 22 and later, {{{kbd(mouse-1)}}}
         will also follow a link.

         #+kindex: mouse-2
         #+kindex: mouse-1
    - {{{key(mouse-3)}}} :: Like {{{kbd(mouse-2)}}}, but force file
         links to be opened with Emacs, and internal links to be
         displayed in another window.[fn:38]

         #+vindex: org-display-internal-link-with-indirect-buffer
         #+kindex: mouse-3
    - {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-v)}}}, ~org-toggle-inline-images~ ::
         #+cindex: inlining images
         #+cindex: images, inlining
         #+vindex: org-startup-with-inline-images
         #+cindex: ~inlineimages~, STARTUP keyword
         #+cindex: ~noinlineimages~, STARTUP keyword
         #+kindex: C-c C-x C-v
         #+findex: org-toggle-inline-images

         Toggle the inline display of linked images.  Normally this
         will only inline images that have no description part in the
         link, i.e., images that will also be inlined during export.
         When called with a prefix argument, also display images that
         do have a link description.  You can ask for inline images to
         be displayed at startup by configuring the variable
         ~org-startup-with-inline-images~.[fn:177]

    - {{{kbd(C-c %)}}}, ~org-mark-ring-push~ ::
         #+kindex: C-c %
         #+findex: org-mark-ring-push
         #+cindex: mark ring

         Push the current position onto the mark ring, to be able to
         return easily.  Commands following an internal link do this
         automatically.

    - {{{kbd(C-c &)}}}, ~org-mark-ring-goto~ ::
         #+kindex: C-c &
         #+findex: org-mark-ring-goto
         #+cindex: links, returning to

         Jump back to a recorded position.  A position is recorded by
         the commands following internal links, and by {{{kbd(C-c %)}}}.  Using this command several times in direct succession
         moves through a ring of previously recorded positions.

  - {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-n)}}}, ~org-next-link~ ::
       @@info:@itemx@@ {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-p)}}}, ~org-previous-link~
       #+cindex: links, finding next/previous
       
       #+kindex: C-c C-x C-p
       #+findex: org-previous-link
       #+kindex: C-c C-x C-n
       #+findex: org-next-link

       Move forward/backward to the next link in the buffer.  At the
       limit of the buffer, the search fails once, and then wraps
       around.  The key bindings for this are really too long; you
       might want to bind this also to {{{kbd(C-n)}}} and
       {{{kbd(C-p)}}}

** Using links outside Org
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Linking from my C source code?
   :END:

You can insert and follow links that have Org syntax not only in Org,
but in any Emacs buffer.  For this, you should create two global
commands, like this (please select suitable global keys yourself):

#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key "\C-c L" 'org-insert-link-global)
  (global-set-key "\C-c o" 'org-open-at-point-global)
#+end_src

** Link abbreviations
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Shortcuts for writing complex links
   :END:
#+cindex: link abbreviations
#+cindex: abbreviation, links

Long URLs can be cumbersome to type, and often many similar links are
needed in a document.  For this you can use link abbreviations.  An
abbreviated link looks like this

#+begin_src org
[[linkword:tag][description]]
#+end_src

#+vindex: org-link-abbrev-alist

{{{noindent}}} where the tag is optional.  The /linkword/ must be a
word, starting with a letter, followed by letters, numbers,
{{{samp(-)}}}, and {{{samp(_)}}}.  Abbreviations are resolved
according to the information in the variable ~org-link-abbrev-alist~
that relates the linkwords to replacement text.  Here is an example:

#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-link-abbrev-alist
    '(("bugzilla"  . "http://10.1.2.9/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=")
      ("url-to-ja" . "http://translate.google.fr/translate?sl=en&tl=ja&u=%h")
      ("google"    . "http://www.google.com/search?q=")
      ("gmap"      . "http://maps.google.com/maps?q=%s")
      ("omap"      . "http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?q=%s&polygon=1")
      ("ads"       . "http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?author=%s&db_key=AST")))
#+end_src

If the replacement text contains the string {{{samp(%s)}}}, it will be
replaced with the tag.  Using {{{samp(%h)}}} instead of {{{samp(%s)}}}
will url-encode the tag (see the example above, where we need to
encode the URL parameter.)  Using {{{samp(%(my-function))}}} will pass
the tag to a custom function, and replace it by the resulting string.

If the replacement text don't contain any specifier, it will simply be
appended to the string in order to create the link.

Instead of a string, you may also specify a function that will be
called with the tag as the only argument to create the link.

With the above setting, you could link to a specific bug with
~[[bugzilla:129]]~, search the web for {{{samp(OrgMode)}}} with
~[[google:OrgMode]]~, show the map location of the Free Software
Foundation ~[[gmap:51 Franklin Street, Boston]]~ or of Carsten office
~[[omap:Science Park 904, Amsterdam, The Netherlands]]~ and find out what
the Org author is doing besides Emacs hacking with ~[[ads:Dominik,C]]~.

If you need special abbreviations just for a single Org buffer, you
can define them in the file with

#+cindex: #+LINK
#+begin_src org
  ,#+LINK: bugzilla  http://10.1.2.9/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=
  ,#+LINK: google    http://www.google.com/search?q=%s
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} In-buffer completion (see [[Completion]]) can be used
after {{{samp([)}}} to complete link abbreviations.  You may also
define a function that implements special (e.g., completion) support
for inserting such a link with {{{kbd(C-c C-l)}}}.  Such a function
should not accept any arguments, and return the full link with
prefix.  You can set the link completion function like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(org-link-set-parameter "type" :complete #'some-completion-function)
#+END_SRC

** Search options
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Linking to a specific location
   :END:
#+cindex: search option in file links
#+cindex: file links, searching

File links can contain additional information to make Emacs jump to a
particular location in the file when following a link.  This can be a
line number or a search option after a double colon.[fn:39]
For example, when the command {{{kbd(C-c l)}}} creates a link (see
[[Handling links]]) to a file, it encodes the words in the current line as
a search string that can be used to find this line back later when
following the link with {{{kbd(C-c C-o)}}}.

Here is the syntax of the different ways to attach a search to a file
link, together with an explanation:

#+begin_src org

- 255 :: Jump to line 255.
- My Target :: Search for a link target ~<<My Target>>~, or do a text search for {{{samp(my target)}}},
     similar to the search in internal links, see [[Internal links]].
     In HTML export (see [[HTML export]]), such a file link will
     become a HTML reference to the corresponding named anchor in the
     linked file.
- *My Target :: In an Org file, restrict search to headlines.
- #my-custom-id :: Link to a heading with a ~CUSTOM_ID~ property
- /regexp/ :: Do a regular expression search for ~regexp~.  This
                    uses the Emacs command ~occur~ to list all matches
                    in a separate window.  If the target file is in
                    Org mode, ~org-occur~ is used to create a sparse
                    tree with the matches.  @c If the target file is a
                    directory, @c ~grep~ will be used to search all
                    files in the directory.

As a degenerate case, a file link with an empty file name can be used
to search the current file.  For example, ~[[file:::find me]]~ does a
search for ~find me~ in the current file, just as
~[[find me]]~ would.

** Custom searches
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: When the default search is not enough
   :END:
#+cindex: custom search strings
#+cindex: search strings, custom

The default mechanism for creating search strings and for doing the
actual search related to a file link may not work correctly in all
cases.  For example, BibTeX database files have many entries like
{{{samp(year="1993")}}} which would not result in good search strings,
because the only unique identification for a BibTeX entry is the
citation key.

#+vindex: org-create-file-search-functions
#+vindex: org-execute-file-search-functions

If you come across such a problem, you can write custom functions to
set the right search string for a particular file type, and to do the
search for the string in the file.  Using ~add-hook~, these functions
need to be added to the hook variables
~org-create-file-search-functions~ and
~org-execute-file-search-functions~.  See the docstring for these
variables for more information.  Org actually uses this mechanism for
BibTeX database files, and you can use the corresponding code as an
implementation example.  See the file {{{file(org-bibtex.el)}}}.

* TODO items
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: Every tree branch can be a TODO item
  :ALT_TITLE: TODO Items
  :END:
#+cindex: TODO items

Org mode does not maintain TODO lists as separate documents.[fn:40]
Instead, TODO items are an integral part of the notes file, because
TODO items usually come up while taking notes! With Org mode, simply
mark any entry in a tree as being a TODO item.  In this way,
information is not duplicated, and the entire context from which the
TODO item emerged is always present.

Of course, this technique for managing TODO items scatters them
throughout your notes file.  Org mode compensates for this by providing
methods to give you an overview of all the things that you have to do.

** TODO basics
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Marking and displaying TODO entries
   :TITLE:    Basic TODO functionality
   :END:

Any headline becomes a TODO item when it starts with the word
{{{samp(TODO)}}}, for example:

#+begin_src org
  ,*** TODO Write letter to Sam Fortune
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} The most important commands to work with TODO entries
are:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-t)}}}, ~org-todo~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-t
  #+cindex: cycling, of TODO states

  Rotate the TODO state of the current item among

  #+begin_example
     ,-> (unmarked) -> TODO -> DONE --.
     '--------------------------------'
  #+end_example

 The same rotation can also be done ``remotely'' from the timeline and
 agenda buffers with the {{{kbd(t)}}} command key (see [[Agenda commands]]).

- {{{kbd(C-u C-c C-t)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-u C-c C-t

  Select a specific keyword using completion or (if it has been set up)
  the fast selection interface.  For the latter, you need to assign keys
  to TODO states, see [[Per-file keywords]], and [[Setting tags]], for
  more information.

  #+kindex: S-@key{right}
  #+kindex: S-@key{left}

- {{{kbdkey(S-,right)}}} {{{kbdkey(S-,left)}}} ::

  #+vindex: org-treat-S-cursor-todo-selection-as-state-change

     Select the following/preceding TODO state, similar to cycling.
     Useful mostly if more than two TODO states are possible 
     (see [[TODO extensions]]).  See also [[Conflicts]], for a discussion of the
     interaction with ~shift-selection-mode~.  See also the variable
     ~org-treat-S-cursor-todo-selection-as-state-change~.

- {{{kbd(C-c / t)}}}, ~org-show-todo-tree~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c / t

  #+cindex: sparse tree, for TODO
  #+vindex: org-todo-keywords

  View TODO items in a /sparse tree/ (see [[Sparse trees]]).  Folds the entire
  buffer, but shows all TODO items (with not-DONE state) and the
  headings hierarchy above them.  With a prefix argument (or by using
  {{{kbd(C-c / T)}}}), search for a specific TODO.  You will be
  prompted for the keyword, and you can also give a list of keywords
  like ~KWD1|KWD2|...~ to list entries that match any one of these
  keywords.  With a numeric prefix argument N, show the tree for the
  Nth keyword in the variable ~org-todo-keywords~.  With two prefix
  arguments, find all TODO states, both un-done and done.

- {{{kbd(C-c a t)}}}, ~org-todo-list~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c a t

  Show the global TODO list.  Collects the TODO items (with not-DONE states)
  from all agenda files (see [[Agenda views]]) into a single buffer.  The new
  buffer will be in ~agenda-mode~, which provides commands to examine and
  manipulate the TODO entries from the new buffer (see [[Agenda commands]]).
  See [[Global TODO list]], for more information.

- {{{kbdkey(S-M-,RET)}}}, ~org-insert-todo-heading~ ::
  #+kindex: S-M-@key{RET}

   Insert a new TODO entry below the current one.


{{{noindent}}}
#+vindex: org-todo-state-tags-triggers
Changing a TODO state can also trigger tag changes.  See the docstring of the
option ~org-todo-state-tags-triggers~ for details.

** TODO extensions
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Work flow and assignments
   :TITLE:    Extended use of TODO keywords
   :END:

#+cindex: extended TODO keywords

#+vindex: org-todo-keywords

By default, marked TODO entries have one of only two states: TODO and
DONE.  Org mode allows you to classify TODO items in more complex ways
with /TODO keywords/ (stored in ~org-todo-keywords~).  With special
setup, the TODO keyword system can work differently in different
files.

Note that /tags/ are another way to classify headlines in general and
TODO items in particular (see [[Tags]]).

*** Workflow states
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: From TODO to DONE in steps
    :TITLE:    TODO keywords as workflow states
    :END:
#+cindex: TODO workflow
#+cindex: workflow states as TODO keywords

You can use TODO keywords to indicate different /sequential/ states
in the process of working on an item, for example:[fn:41]

#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
  '((sequence "TODO" "FEEDBACK" "VERIFY" "|" "DONE" "DELEGATED")))
#+end_src

The vertical bar separates the TODO keywords (states that /need
action/) from the DONE states (which need /no further action/).  If
you don't provide the separator bar, the last state is used as the DONE
state.

#+cindex: completion, of TODO keywords

With this setup, the command {{{kbd(C-c C-t)}}} will cycle an entry
from TODO to FEEDBACK, then to VERIFY, and finally to DONE and
DELEGATED.  You may also use a numeric prefix argument to quickly
select a specific state.  For example {{{kbd(C-3 C-c C-t)}}} will
change the state immediately to VERIFY.  Or you can use
{{{kbdkey(S-,left)}}} to go backward through the sequence.  If you
define many keywords, you can use in-buffer completion (see [[Completion]]) or
even a special one-key selection scheme (see [[Fast access to TODO states]])
to insert these words into the buffer.  Changing a TODO state can be
logged with a timestamp, see [[Tracking TODO state changes]], for
more information.

*** TODO types
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: I do this, Fred does the rest
    :TITLE:    TODO keywords as types
    :END:
#+cindex: TODO types
#+cindex: names as TODO keywords
#+cindex: types as TODO keywords

The second possibility is to use TODO keywords to indicate different
/types/ of action items.  For example, you might want to indicate
that items are for ``work'' or ``home''.  Or, when you work with several
people on a single project, you might want to assign action items
directly to persons, by using their names as TODO keywords.  This would
be set up like this:

#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords '((type "Fred" "Sara" "Lucy" "|" "DONE")))
#+end_src

In this case, different keywords do not indicate a sequence, but rather
different types.  So the normal work flow would be to assign a task to a
person, and later to mark it DONE.  Org mode supports this style by adapting
the workings of the command {{{kbd(C-c C-t)}}}.[fn:42]  When used several
times in succession, it will still cycle through all names, in order to first
select the right type for a task.  But when you return to the item after some
time and execute {{{kbd(C-c C-t)}}} again, it will switch from any name directly
to DONE.  Use prefix arguments or completion to quickly select a specific
name.  You can also review the items of a specific TODO type in a sparse tree
by using a numeric prefix to {{{kbd(C-c / t)}}}.  For example, to see all things
Lucy has to do, you would use {{{kbd(C-3 C-c / t)}}}.  To collect Lucy's items
from all agenda files into a single buffer, you would use the numeric prefix
argument as well when creating the global TODO list: {{{kbd(C-3 C-c a t)}}}.

*** Multiple sets in one file
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Mixing it all, and still finding your way
    :TITLE:    Multiple keyword sets in one file
    :END:
#+cindex: TODO keyword sets

Sometimes you may want to use different sets of TODO keywords in
parallel.  For example, you may want to have the basic
~TODO~ / ~DONE~, but also a workflow for bug fixing, and a
separate state indicating that an item has been canceled (so it is not
DONE, but also does not require action).  Your setup would then look
like this:

#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
      '((sequence "TODO" "|" "DONE")
        (sequence "REPORT" "BUG" "KNOWNCAUSE" "|" "FIXED")
        (sequence "|" "CANCELED")))
#+end_src

The keywords should all be different, this helps Org mode to keep track
of which subsequence should be used for a given entry.  In this setup,
{{{kbd(C-c C-t)}}} only operates within a subsequence, so it switches from
~DONE~ to (nothing) to ~TODO~, and from ~FIXED~ to
(nothing) to ~REPORT~.  Therefore you need a mechanism to initially
select the correct sequence.  Besides the obvious ways like typing a
keyword or using completion, you may also apply the following commands:

#+kindex: C-S-@key{right}
#+kindex: C-S-@key{left}
#+kindex: C-u C-u C-c C-t
#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-u C-u C-c C-t)}}} {{{kbdkey(C-S-,right)}}} {{{kbdkey(C-S-,left)}}} ::

  These keys jump from one TODO subset to the next.  In the above
  example, {{{kbd(C-u C-u C-c C-t)}}} or {{{kbdkey(C-S-,right)}}}
  would jump from ~TODO~ or ~DONE~ to ~REPORT~, and any of the
  words in the second row to ~CANCELED~.  Note that the
  {{{kbd(C-S-)}}} key binding conflict with ~shift-selection-mode~
  (see [[Conflicts]]).

- {{{kbdkey(S-,right)}}} {{{kbdkey(S-,left)}}} ::
  #+kindex: S-@key{right}
  #+kindex: S-@key{left}

  {{{kbdkey(S-,left)}}} and {{{kbdkey(S-,right)}}} walk through /all/
  keywords from all sets, so for example {{{kbdkey(S-,right)}}} would switch
  from ~DONE~ to ~REPORT~ in the example above.  See also
  [[Conflicts]], for a discussion of the interaction with
  ~shift-selection-mode~.

*** Fast access to TODO states
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Single letter selection of state
    :END:
If you would like to quickly change an entry to an arbitrary TODO state
instead of cycling through the states, you can set up keys for single-letter
access to the states.  This is done by adding the selection character after
each keyword, in parentheses.[fn:43]  For example:

#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
      '((sequence "TODO(t)" "|" "DONE(d)")
        (sequence "REPORT(r)" "BUG(b)" "KNOWNCAUSE(k)" "|" "FIXED(f)")
        (sequence "|" "CANCELED(c)")))
#+end_src

#+vindex: org-fast-tag-selection-include-todo

If you then press {{{kbd(C-c C-t)}}} followed by the selection key,
the entry will be switched to this state.  {{{kbd(SPC)}}} can be used
to remove any TODO keyword from an entry.[fn:44]

*** Per-file keywords
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Different files, different requirements
    :TITLE:    Setting up keywords for individual files
    :END:
#+cindex: keyword options
#+cindex: per-file keywords
#+cindex: #+TODO
#+cindex: #+TYP_TODO
#+cindex: #+SEQ_TODO

It can be very useful to use different aspects of the TODO mechanism in
different files.  For file-local settings, you need to add special lines
to the file which set the keywords and interpretation for that file
only.  For example, to set one of the two examples discussed above, you
need one of the following lines, starting in column zero anywhere in the
file:

#+begin_example
   ,#+TODO: TODO FEEDBACK VERIFY | DONE CANCELED
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} (you may also write ~#+SEQ_TODO~ to be explicit about the
interpretation, but it means the same as ~#+TODO~), or

#+begin_example
   ,#+TYP_TODO: Fred Sara Lucy Mike | DONE
#+end_example

A setup for using several sets in parallel would be:

#+begin_example
   ,#+TODO: TODO | DONE
   ,#+TODO: REPORT BUG KNOWNCAUSE | FIXED
   ,#+TODO: | CANCELED
#+end_example

#+cindex: completion, of option keywords
#+kindex: M-@key{TAB}
{{{noindent}}} To make sure you are using the correct keyword, type
{{{samp(#+)}}} into the buffer and then use {{{kbdkey(M-,TAB)}}} completion.

#+cindex: DONE, final TODO keyword
Remember that the keywords after the vertical bar (or the last keyword
if no bar is there) must always mean that the item is DONE (although you
may use a different word).  After changing one of these lines, use
{{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} with the cursor still in the line to make the changes
known to Org mode.[fn:45]

*** Faces for TODO keywords
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Highlighting states
    :END:
#+cindex: faces, for TODO keywords
#+vindex: org-todo @r{(face)}
#+vindex: org-done @r{(face)}
#+vindex: org-todo-keyword-faces

Org mode highlights TODO keywords with special faces: ~org-todo~
for keywords indicating that an item still has to be acted upon, and
~org-done~ for keywords indicating that an item is finished.  If
you are using more than 2 different states, you might want to use
special faces for some of them.  This can be done using the variable
~org-todo-keyword-faces~.  For example:

#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-todo-keyword-faces
      '(("TODO" . org-warning) ("STARTED" . "yellow")
        ("CANCELED" . (:foreground "blue" :weight bold))))
#+end_src

While using a list with face properties as shown for CANCELED /should/
work, this does not always seem to be the case.  If necessary, define a
special face and use that.  A string is interpreted as a color.  The variable
~org-faces-easy-properties~ determines if that color is interpreted as a
foreground or a background color.

*** TODO dependencies
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: When one task needs to wait for others
    :END:
#+cindex: TODO dependencies
#+cindex: dependencies, of TODO states
#+vindex: org-enforce-todo-dependencies
#+cindex: property, ORDERED

The structure of Org files (hierarchy and lists) makes it easy to define TODO
dependencies.  Usually, a parent TODO task should not be marked DONE until
all subtasks (defined as children tasks) are marked as DONE.  And sometimes
there is a logical sequence to a number of (sub)tasks, so that one task
cannot be acted upon before all siblings above it are done.  If you customize
the variable ~org-enforce-todo-dependencies~, Org will block entries
from changing state to DONE while they have children that are not DONE.
Furthermore, if an entry has a property ~ORDERED~, each of its children
will be blocked until all earlier siblings are marked DONE.  Here is an
example:

#+begin_src org
  ,* TODO Blocked until (two) is done
  ,** DONE one
  ,** TODO two
  
  ,* Parent
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ORDERED: t
    :END:
  ,** TODO a
  ,** TODO b, needs to wait for (a)
  ,** TODO c, needs to wait for (a) and (b)
#+end_src

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-x o)}}}, ~org-toggle-ordered-property~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x o
  #+vindex: org-track-ordered-property-with-tag
  #+cindex: property, ORDERED

  Toggle the ~ORDERED~ property of the current entry.  A property is used
  for this behavior because this should be local to the current entry, not
  inherited like a tag.  However, if you would like to /track/ the value of
  this property with a tag for better visibility, customize the variable
  ~org-track-ordered-property-with-tag~.
- {{{kbd(C-u C-u C-u C-c C-t)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-u C-u C-u C-c C-t

  Change TODO state, circumventing any state blocking.


#+vindex: org-agenda-dim-blocked-tasks

If you set the variable ~org-agenda-dim-blocked-tasks~, TODO entries
that cannot be closed because of such dependencies will be shown in a dimmed
font or even made invisible in agenda views (see [[Agenda views]]).

#+cindex: checkboxes and TODO dependencies
#+vindex: org-enforce-todo-dependencies

You can also block changes of TODO states by looking at checkboxes
(see [[Checkboxes]]).  If you set the variable
~org-enforce-todo-checkbox-dependencies~, an entry that has unchecked
checkboxes will be blocked from switching to DONE.

If you need more complex dependency structures, for example dependencies
between entries in different trees or files, check out the contributed
module {{{file(org-depend.el)}}}.

{{{page}}}

** Progress logging
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Dates and notes for progress
   :END:
#+cindex: progress logging
#+cindex: logging, of progress

Org mode can automatically record a timestamp and possibly a note when
you mark a TODO item as DONE, or even each time you change the state of
a TODO item.  This system is highly configurable, settings can be on a
per-keyword basis and can be localized to a file or even a subtree.  For
information on how to clock working time for a task, see [[Clocking work time]].

*** Closing items
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: When was this entry marked DONE?
    :END:

The most basic logging is to keep track of /when/ a certain TODO
item was finished.  This is achieved with:[fn:46]

#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-log-done 'time)
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} Then each time you turn an entry from a TODO (not-done)
state into any of the DONE states, a line {{{samp(CLOSED: [timestamp])}}} will be inserted just after the headline.  If you turn
the entry back into a TODO item through further state cycling, that
line will be removed again.  If you want to record a note along with
the timestamp, use:[fn:47]

#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-log-done 'note)
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} You will then be prompted for a note, and that note
will be stored below the entry with a {{{samp(Closing Note)}}}
heading.

In the timeline (see [[Timeline for a single file]]) and in the agenda
(see [[Weekly/daily agenda]]), you can then use the {{{kbd(l)}}} key to
display the TODO items with a {{{samp(CLOSED)}}} timestamp on each
day, giving you an overview of what has been done.

*** Tracking TODO state changes
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: When did the status change?
    :END:
#+cindex: drawer, for state change recording
#+vindex: org-log-states-order-reversed
#+vindex: org-log-into-drawer
#+cindex: property, LOG_INTO_DRAWER

When TODO keywords are used as workflow states (see [[Workflow
states]]), you might want to keep track of when a state change occurred
and maybe take a note about this change.  You can either record just a
timestamp, or a time-stamped note for a change.  These records will be
inserted after the headline as an itemized list, newest first.[fn:48]
When taking a lot of notes, you might want to get the notes out of the
way into a drawer (see [[Drawers]]).  Customize the variable
~org-log-into-drawer~ to get this behavior---the recommended drawer
for this is called ~LOGBOOK~.[fn:178] You can also overrule the setting
of this variable for a subtree by setting a ~LOG_INTO_DRAWER~
property.

Since it is normally too much to record a note for every state, Org
mode expects configuration on a per-keyword basis for this.  This is
achieved by adding special markers {{{samp(!)}}} (for a timestamp) or
{{{samp(@)}}} (for a note with timestamp) in parentheses after each
keyword.  For example, with the setting:

#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
  '((sequence "TODO(t)" "WAIT(w@@/!)" "|" "DONE(d!)" "CANCELED(c@@)")))
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}}
#+vindex: org-log-done

you not only define global TODO keywords and fast access keys, but
also request that a time is recorded when the entry is set to
DONE, and that a note is recorded when switching to WAIT or
CANCELED.[fn:49] The setting for WAIT is even more special: the {{{samp(!)}}}
after the slash means that in addition to the note taken when entering
the state, a timestamp should be recorded when /leaving/ the WAIT
state, if and only if the /target/ state does not configure logging
for entering it.  So it has no effect when switching from WAIT to DONE,
because DONE is configured to record a timestamp only.  But when
switching from WAIT back to TODO, the {{{samp(/!)}}} in the WAIT
setting now triggers a timestamp even though TODO has no logging
configured.

To record a timestamp without a note for TODO keywords configured with
{{{samp(@)}}}, just type {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} to enter a blank note
when prompted.

You can use the exact same syntax for setting logging preferences local
to a buffer:

#+begin_example
   ,#+TODO: TODO(t) WAIT(w@/!) | DONE(d!) CANCELED(c@)
#+end_example

#+cindex: property, LOGGING

In order to define logging settings that are local to a subtree or a
single item, define a LOGGING property in this entry.  Any non-empty
LOGGING property resets all logging settings to nil.  You may then turn
on logging for this specific tree using STARTUP keywords like
~lognotedone~ or ~logrepeat~, as well as adding state specific
settings like ~TODO(!)~.  For example:

#+begin_example
   ,* TODO Log each state with only a time
     :PROPERTIES:
     :LOGGING: TODO(!) WAIT(!) DONE(!) CANCELED(!)
     :END:
   ,* TODO Only log when switching to WAIT, and when repeating
     :PROPERTIES:
     :LOGGING: WAIT(@) logrepeat
     :END:
   ,* TODO No logging at all
     :PROPERTIES:
     :LOGGING: nil
     :END:
#+end_example

*** Tracking your habits
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How consistent have you been?
    :END:
    :LOGBOOK:
    - State "DONE"       from "DONE"       [2013-01-07 Mon 14:10]
    - State "DONE"       from ""           [2013-01-07 Mon 14:10]
    :END:
#+cindex: habits

Org has the ability to track the consistency of a special category of TODOs,
called "habits."  A habit has the following properties:

  1. You have enabled the ~habits~ module by customizing the variable
     ~org-modules~.

  2. The habit is a TODO item, with a TODO keyword representing an
     open state.

  3. The property ~STYLE~ is set to the value ~habit~.

  4. The TODO has a scheduled date, usually with a ~.+~ style repeat
     interval.  A ~++~ style may be appropriate for habits with time
     constraints, e.g., must be done on weekends, or a ~+~ style for
     an unusual habit that can have a backlog, e.g., weekly reports.

  5. The TODO may also have minimum and maximum ranges specified by
     using the syntax {{{samp(.+2d/3d)}}}, which says that you want to
     do the task at least every three days, but at most every two
     days.

  6. You must also have state logging for the ~DONE~ state enabled
     (see [[Tracking TODO state changes]]), in order for historical
     data to be represented in the consistency graph.  If it is not
     enabled it is not an error, but the consistency graphs will be
     largely meaningless.


To give you an idea of what the above rules look like in action, here's an
actual habit with some history:

#+begin_example
   ,** TODO Shave
      SCHEDULED: <2009-10-17 Sat .+2d/4d>
      - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-15 Thu]

      :END:
#+end_example

What this habit says is: I want to shave at most every 2 days (given
by the ~SCHEDULED~ date and repeat interval) and at least every 4
days.  If today is the 15th, then the habit first appears in the agenda
on Oct 17, after the minimum of 2 days has elapsed, and will appear
overdue on Oct 19, after four days have elapsed.

What's really useful about habits is that they are displayed along
with a consistency graph, to show how consistent you've been at
getting that task done in the past.  This graph shows every day that
the task was done over the past three weeks, with colors for each day.
The colors used are:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
  - ~Blue~ :: If the task wasn't to be done yet on that day.
  - ~Green~ :: If the task could have been done on that day.
  - ~Yellow~ :: If the task was going to be overdue the next day.
  - ~Red~ :: If the task was overdue on that day.


In addition to coloring each day, the day is also marked with an
asterisk if the task was actually done that day, and an exclamation
mark to show where the current day falls in the graph.

There are several configuration variables that can be used to change
the way habits are displayed in the agenda.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
  - ~org-habit-graph-column~ :: The buffer column at which the
       consistency graph should be drawn.  This will overwrite any text
       in that column, so it is a good idea to keep your habits'
       titles brief and to the point.

  - ~org-habit-preceding-days~ :: The amount of history, in days before
       today, to appear in consistency graphs.

  - ~org-habit-following-days~ :: The number of days after today that
       will appear in consistency graphs.

  - ~org-habit-show-habits-only-for-today~ :: If non-nil, only show
       habits in today's agenda view.  This is set to true by default.


Lastly, pressing {{{kbd(K)}}} in the agenda buffer will cause habits
to temporarily be disabled and they won't appear at all.  Press
{{{kbd(K)}}} again to bring them back.  They are also subject to tag
filtering, if you have habits which should only be done in certain
contexts, for example.

** FIXME Priorities
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Some things are more important than others
   :END:
#+cindex: priorities

If you use Org mode extensively, you may end up with enough TODO items that
it starts to make sense to prioritize them.  Prioritizing can be done by
placing a /priority cookie/ into the headline of a TODO item, like this:

#+begin_example
   ,*** TODO [#A] Write letter to Sam Fortune
#+end_example

#+vindex: org-priority-faces

{{{noindent}}} By default, Org mode supports three priorities: {{{samp(A)}}},
{{{samp(B)}}}, and {{{samp(C)}}}.  {{{samp(A)}}} is the highest
priority.  An entry without a cookie is treated just like priority
{{{samp(B)}}}.  Priorities make a difference only for sorting in the
agenda (see [[Weekly/daily agenda]]); outside the agenda, they have no
inherent meaning to Org mode.  The cookies can be highlighted with
special faces by customizing the variable ~org-priority-faces~.

Priorities can be attached to any outline node; they do not need to be TODO
items.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
  - {{{kbd(C-c XXX)}}} ::
    #+kindex: C-c ,
    # #+kindex: @key{C-c ,}
    # Preceding line won't export to pdf
    #+findex: org-priority
    # Should be C-c ,
    Set the priority of the current headline (~org-priority~).  The
    command prompts for a priority character {{{samp(A)}}}, {{{samp(B)}}}
    or {{{samp(C)}}}.  When you press {{{key(SPC)}}}} instead, the priority
    cookie is removed from the headline.  The priorities can also be
    changed ``remotely'' from the timeline and agenda buffer with the
    {{{kbd(\,)}}} command (see [[Agenda commands]]).
  
  - {{{kbdkey(S-,up)}}}, {{{kbdkey(S-,down)}}}, {{{command(org-priority-up)}}}, {{{command(org-priority-down)}}} ::
    #+vindex: org-priority-start-cycle-with-default
    
    Increase/decrease priority of current headline.[fn:50] Note
    that these keys are also used to modify timestamps
    (see [[Creating timestamps]]).  See also [[Conflicts]], for a
    discussion of the interaction with ~shift-selection-mode~.


#+vindex: org-highest-priority
#+vindex: org-lowest-priority
#+vindex: org-default-priority

You can change the range of allowed priorities by setting the
variables ~org-highest-priority~, ~org-lowest-priority~, and
~org-default-priority~.  For an individual buffer, you may set these
values (highest, lowest, default) like this (please make sure that the
highest priority is earlier in the alphabet than the lowest priority):

#+cindex: #+PRIORITIES

#+begin_example
   ,#+PRIORITIES: A C B
#+end_example

** Breaking down tasks
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Splitting a task into manageable pieces
   :END:
#+cindex: tasks, breaking down
#+cindex: statistics, for TODO items
#+vindex: org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels

It is often advisable to break down large tasks into smaller,
manageable subtasks.  You can do this by creating an outline tree below
a TODO item, with detailed subtasks on the tree.[fn:51] To keep the
overview over the fraction of subtasks that are already completed,
insert either {{{samp([/])}}} or {{{samp([%])}}} anywhere in the
headline.  These cookies will be updated each time the TODO status of a
child changes, or when pressing {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} on the cookie.  For
example:

#+begin_example
   ,* Organize Party [33%]
   ,** TODO Call people [1/2]
   ,*** TODO Peter
   ,*** DONE Sarah
   ,** TODO Buy food
   ,** DONE Talk to neighbor
#+end_example

#+cindex: property, COOKIE_DATA

If a heading has both checkboxes and TODO children below it, the
meaning of the statistics cookie become ambiguous.  Set the property
~COOKIE_DATA~ to either {{{samp(checkbox)}}} or {{{samp(todo)}}} to
resolve this issue.

#+vindex: org-hierarchical-todo-statistics

If you would like to have the statistics cookie count any TODO entries
in the subtree (not just direct children), configure the variable
~org-hierarchical-todo-statistics~.  To do this for a single subtree,
include the word {{{samp(recursive)}}} into the value of the
~COOKIE_DATA~ property.

#+begin_example
   ,* Parent capturing statistics [2/20]
     :PROPERTIES:
     :COOKIE_DATA: todo recursive
     :END:
#+end_example

If you would like a TODO entry to automatically change to DONE
when all children are done, you can use the following setup:

#+header: :exports code
#+header: :eval no
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-summary-todo (n-done n-not-done)
  "Switch entry to DONE when all subentries are done, to TODO otherwise."
  (let (org-log-done org-log-states)   ; turn off logging
    (org-todo (if (= n-not-done 0) "DONE" "TODO"))))

(add-hook 'org-after-todo-statistics-hook 'org-summary-todo)
#+end_src

Another possibility is the use of checkboxes to identify (a hierarchy
of) a large number of subtasks (see [[Checkboxes]]).

** Checkboxes
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Tick-off lists
   :END:

#+cindex: checkboxes
#+vindex: org-list-automatic-rules

Every item in a plain list (see [[Plain lists]]) can be made into a
checkbox by starting it with the string {{{samp([ ])}}}.[fn:52] This
feature is similar to TODO items (see [[TODO items]]), but is more
lightweight.  Checkboxes are not included into the global TODO list, so
they are often great to split a task into a number of simple steps.  Or
you can use them in a shopping list.  To toggle a checkbox, use
{{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}}, or use the mouse (thanks to Piotr Zielinski's
{{{file(org-mouse.el)}}}).

Here is an example of a checkbox list.

#+begin_example
   ,* TODO Organize party [2/4]
     - [-] call people [1/3]
       - [ ] Peter
       - [X] Sarah
       - [ ] Sam
     - [X] order food
     - [ ] think about what music to play
     - [X] talk to the neighbors
#+end_example

Checkboxes work hierarchically, so if a checkbox item has children
that are checkboxes, toggling one of the children checkboxes will make
the parent checkbox reflect if none, some, or all of the children are
checked.

#+cindex: statistics, for checkboxes
#+cindex: checkbox statistics
#+cindex: property, COOKIE_DATA
#+vindex: org-hierarchical-checkbox-statistics

The {{{samp([2/4])}}} and {{{samp([1/3])}}} in the first and second
line are cookies indicating how many checkboxes present in this entry
have been checked off, and the total number of checkboxes present.
This can give you an idea on how many checkboxes remain, even without
opening a folded entry.  The cookies can be placed into a headline or
into (the first line of) a plain list item.  Each cookie covers
checkboxes of direct children structurally below the headline/item on
which the cookie appears.[fn:53] You have to insert the cookie
yourself by typing either {{{samp([/])}}} or {{{samp([%])}}}.  With
{{{samp([/])}}} you get an {{{samp(n out of m)}}} result, as in the
examples above.  With {{{samp([%])}}} you get information about the
percentage of checkboxes checked (in the above example, this would be
{{{samp([50%])}}} and {{{samp([33%])}}}, respectively).  In a headline,
a cookie can count either checkboxes below the heading or TODO states
of children, and it will display whatever was changed last.  Set the
property ~COOKIE_DATA~ to either {{{samp(checkbox)}}} or
{{{samp(todo)}}} to resolve this issue.

#+cindex: blocking, of checkboxes
#+cindex: checkbox blocking
#+cindex: property, ORDERED

If the current outline node has an ~ORDERED~ property, checkboxes must
be checked off in sequence, and an error will be thrown if you try to
check off a box while there are unchecked boxes above it.

{{{noindent}}} The following commands work with checkboxes:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}}, ~org-toggle-checkbox~ :: Toggle checkbox status
     or (with prefix arg) checkbox presence at point.  With a single
     prefix argument, add an empty checkbox or remove the current
     one.[fn:54] With a double prefix argument, set it to
     {{{samp([-])}}}, which is considered to be an intermediate state.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-b)}}}, ~org-toggle-checkbox~ :: Toggle checkbox
     status or (with prefix arg) checkbox presence at point.  With
     double prefix argument, set it to {{{samp([-])}}}, which is
     considered to be an intermediate state.

  - If there is an active region, toggle the first checkbox in the region
    and set all remaining boxes to the same status as the first.  With a prefix
    arg, add or remove the checkbox for all items in the region.

  - If the cursor is in a headline, toggle checkboxes in the region
    between this headline and the next (so /not/ the entire subtree).

  - If there is no active region, just toggle the checkbox at point.


- {{{kbdkey(M-S-,RET)}}}, ~org-insert-todo-heading~ :: Insert a new
     item with a checkbox.  This works only if the cursor is already in
     a plain list item (see [[Plain lists]]).

- {{{kbd(C-c C-x o)}}}, ~org-toggle-ordered-property~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x o
  #+vindex: org-track-ordered-property-with-tag
  #+cindex: property, ORDERED
  
  Toggle the ~ORDERED~ property of the entry, to toggle if checkboxes
  must be checked off in sequence.  A property is used for this
  behavior because this should be local to the current entry, not
  inherited like a tag.  However, if you would like to /track/ the
  value of this property with a tag for better visibility,
  customize the variable ~org-track-ordered-property-with-tag~.

- {{{kbd(C-c #)}}}, ~org-update-statistics-cookies~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c #

  Update the statistics cookie in the current outline entry.  When
  called with a {{{kbd(C-u)}}} prefix, update the entire file.
  Checkbox statistic cookies are updated automatically if you
  toggle checkboxes with {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} and make new ones with
  {{{kbdkey(M-S-,RET)}}}.  TODO statistics cookies update when
  changing TODO states.  If you delete boxes/entries or add/change
  them by hand, use this command to get things back into sync.

* Tags
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: Tagging headlines and matching sets of tags
  :END:
#+cindex: tags
#+cindex: headline tagging
#+cindex: matching, tags
#+cindex: sparse tree, tag based

An excellent way to implement labels and contexts for
cross-correlating information is to assign /tags/ to headlines.  Org
mode has extensive support for tags.

#+vindex: org-tag-faces

Every headline can contain a list of tags; they occur at the end of
the headline.  Tags are normal words containing letters, numbers,
{{{samp(_)}}}, and {{{samp(@)}}}.  Tags must be preceded and followed
by a single colon, e.g., {{{samp(:work:)}}}.  Several tags can be
specified, as in {{{samp(:work:urgent:)}}}.  Tags will by default be in
bold face with the same color as the headline.  You may specify special
faces for specific tags using the variable ~org-tag-faces~, in much
the same way as you can for TODO keywords (see [[Faces for TODO keywords]]).

** Tag inheritance
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Tags use the tree structure of an outline
   :END:
#+cindex: tag inheritance
#+cindex: inheritance, of tags
#+cindex: sublevels, inclusion into tags match

/Tags/ make use of the hierarchical structure of outline trees.  If a
heading has a certain tag, all subheadings will inherit the tag as
well.  For example, in the list

#+begin_example
   ,* Meeting with the French group      :work:
   ,** Summary by Frank                  :boss:notes:
   ,*** TODO Prepare slides for him      :action:
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} the final heading will have the tags
{{{samp(:work:)}}}, {{{samp(:boss:)}}}, {{{samp(:notes:)}}}, and
{{{samp(:action:)}}} even though the final heading is not explicitly
marked with those tags.  You can also set tags that all entries in a
file should inherit just as if these tags were defined in a
hypothetical level zero that surrounds the entire file.  Use a line
like this:[fn:55]

#+cindex: #+FILETAGS
#+begin_example
   ,#+FILETAGS: :Peter:Boss:Secret:
#+end_example

#+vindex: org-use-tag-inheritance
#+vindex: org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance

{{{noindent}}} To limit tag inheritance to specific tags, or to turn
it off entirely, use the variables ~org-use-tag-inheritance~ and
~org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance~.

#+vindex: org-tags-match-list-sublevels

When a headline matches during a tags search while tag inheritance is
turned on, all the sublevels in the same tree will (for a simple match
form) match as well.[fn:56] The list of matches may then become very
long.  If you only want to see the first tags match in a subtree,
configure the variable ~org-tags-match-list-sublevels~ (not
recommended).

** Setting tags
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: How to assign tags to a headline
   :END:
#+cindex: setting tags
#+cindex: tags, setting
#+kindex: M-@key{TAB}

Tags can simply be typed into the buffer at the end of a headline.
After a colon, {{{kbdkey(M-,TAB)}}} offers completion on tags.  There is
also a special command for inserting tags:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-q)}}}, ~org-set-tags-command~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-q

  #+cindex: completion, of tags
  #+vindex: org-tags-column

  Enter new tags for the current headline.  Org mode will either offer
  completion or a special single-key interface for setting tags, see
  below.  After pressing {{{key(RET)}}}, the tags will be inserted and aligned
  to ~org-tags-column~.  When called with a {{{kbd(C-u)}}} prefix, all
  tags in the current buffer will be aligned to that column, just to make
  things look nice.  TAGS are automatically realigned after promotion,
  demotion, and TODO state changes (see [[TODO basics]]).

- {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}}, ~org-set-tags-command~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-c

  When the cursor is in a headline, this does the same as {{{kbd(C-c C-q)}}}.


#+vindex: org-tag-alist

Org supports tag insertion based on a /list of tags/.  By default this
list is constructed dynamically, containing all tags currently used in
the buffer.  You may also globally specify a hard list of tags with the
variable ~org-tag-alist~.  Finally you can set the default tags for a
given file with lines like

#+cindex: #+TAGS
#+begin_example
   ,#+TAGS: @work @home @tennisclub
   ,#+TAGS: laptop car pc sailboat
#+end_example

If you have globally defined your preferred set of tags using the
variable ~org-tag-alist~, but would like to use a dynamic tag list
in a specific file, add an empty TAGS option line to that file:

#+begin_example
   ,#+TAGS:
#+end_example

#+vindex: org-tag-persistent-alist

If you have a preferred set of tags that you would like to use in
every file, in addition to those defined on a per-file basis by TAGS
option lines, then you may specify a list of tags with the variable
~org-tag-persistent-alist~.  You may turn this off on a per-file basis
by adding a STARTUP option line to that file:

#+begin_example
   ,#+STARTUP: noptag
#+end_example

By default Org mode uses the standard minibuffer completion facilities
for entering tags.  However, it also implements another, quicker, tag
selection method called /fast tag selection/.  This allows you to
select and deselect tags with just a single key press.  For this to
work well you should assign unique letters to most of your commonly
used tags.  You can do this globally by configuring the variable
~org-tag-alist~ in your {{{file(.emacs)}}} file.  For example, you may
find the need to tag many items in different files with
{{{samp(:@home:)}}}.  In this case you can set something like:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-tag-alist '(("@@work" . ?w) ("@@home" . ?h) ("laptop" . ?l)))
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} If the tag is only relevant to the file you are working
on, then you can instead set the TAGS option line as:

#+begin_example
   ,#+TAGS: @work(w)  @home(h)  @tennisclub(t)  laptop(l)  pc(p)
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} The tags interface will show the available tags in a splash
window.  If you want to start a new line after a specific tag, insert
~\n~ into the tag list, like this:

#+begin_example
   ,#+TAGS: @work(w)  @home(h)  @tennisclub(t) \n laptop(l)  pc(p)
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} or write them in two lines:

#+begin_example
   ,#+TAGS: @work(w)  @home(h)  @tennisclub(t)
   ,#+TAGS: laptop(l)  pc(p)
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}}
You can also group together tags that are mutually exclusive by using
braces, as in:

#+begin_example
   ,#+TAGS: { @work(w)  @home(h)  @tennisclub(t) }  laptop(l)  pc(p)
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} you indicate that at most one of {{{samp(@work)}}},
{{{samp(@home)}}}, and {{{samp(@tennisclub)}}} should be selected.
Multiple such groups are allowed.

{{{noindent}}} Don't forget to press {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} with the
cursor in one of these lines to activate any changes.

{{{noindent}}} To set these mutually exclusive groups in the variable
~org-tags-alist~, you must use the dummy tags ~:startgroup~ and
~:endgroup~ instead of the braces.  Similarly, you can use ~:newline~
to indicate a line break.  The previous example would be set globally
by the following configuration:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-tag-alist '((:startgroup . nil)
                      ("@@work" . ?w) ("@@home" . ?h)
                      ("@@tennisclub" . ?t)
                      (:endgroup . nil)
                      ("laptop" . ?l) ("pc" . ?p)))
#+end_src

If at least one tag has a selection key then pressing {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} will
automatically present you with a special interface, listing inherited tags,
the tags of the current headline, and a list of all valid tags with
corresponding keys.[fn:57]  In this interface, you can use the following
keys:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(a-z...)}}} ::
  #+kindex: a-z...

  Pressing keys assigned to tags will add or remove them from the list of
  tags in the current line.  Selecting a tag in a group of mutually
  exclusive tags will turn off any other tags from that group.

- {{{key(TAB)}}} ::
  #+kindex: @key{TAB}

  Enter a tag in the minibuffer, even if the tag is not in the predefined
  list.  You will be able to complete on all tags present in the buffer.
  You can also add several tags: just separate them with a comma.

- {{{key(SPC)}}} ::
  #+kindex: @key{SPC}

  Clear all tags for this line.

- {{{key(RET)}}} ::
  #+kindex: @key{RET}

  Accept the modified set.

- C-g ::

  Abort without installing changes.

- q ::

  If {{{kbd(q)}}} is not assigned to a tag, it aborts like {{{kbd(C-g)}}}.

- ! ::

  Turn off groups of mutually exclusive tags.  Use this to (as an
  exception) assign several tags from such a group.

- C-c ::

  Toggle auto-exit after the next change (see below).
  If you are using expert mode, the first {{{kbd(C-c)}}} will display the
  selection window.


{{{noindent}}} This method lets you assign tags to a headline with
very few keys.  With the above setup, you could clear the current tags
and set {{{samp(@home)}}}, {{{samp(laptop)}}} and {{{samp(pc)}}} tags
with just the following keys: {{{ksksksk(C-c C-c,SPC,h l p,RET)}}}.  Switching from {{{samp(@home)}}} to
{{{samp(@work)}}} would be done with {{{kbdspckey(C-c C-c w,RET)}}} or
alternatively with {{{kbd(C-c C-c C-c w)}}}.  Adding the non-predefined
tag {{{samp(Sarah)}}} could be done with 
{{{ksksksksk(C-c C-c,TAB,S a r a h,RET,RET)}}}.

#+vindex: org-fast-tag-selection-single-key

If you find that most of the time you need only a single key press to
modify your list of tags, set the variable
~org-fast-tag-selection-single-key~.  Then you no longer have to press
{{{key(RET)}}} to exit fast tag selection---it will immediately exit after
the first change.  If you then occasionally need more keys, press
{{{kbd(C-c)}}} to turn off auto-exit for the current tag selection
process (in effect: start selection with {{{kbd(C-c C-c C-c)}}}
instead of {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}}).  If you set the variable to the value
~expert~, the special window is not even shown for single-key tag
selection, it comes up only when you press an extra {{{kbd(C-c)}}}.

** Tag searches
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Searching for combinations of tags
   :END:
#+cindex: tag searches
#+cindex: searching for tags

Once a system of tags has been set up, it can be used to collect related
information into special lists.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c / m)}}}, ~C-c \~ ~org-match-sparse-tree~ ::

  Create a sparse tree with all headlines matching a tags search.  With a
  {{{kbd(C-u)}}} prefix argument, ignore headlines that are not a TODO
  line.

- {{{kbd(C-c a m)}}}, ~org-tags-view~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c a m

  Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files.
  See [[Matching tags and properties]].

- {{{kbd(C-c a M)}}}, ~org-tags-view~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c a M
  #+vindex: org-tags-match-list-sublevels

  Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files, but check
  only TODO items and force checking subitems (see variable
  ~org-tags-match-list-sublevels~).


These commands all prompt for a match string which allows basic
Boolean logic like {{{samp(+boss+urgent-project1)}}}, to find entries
with tags {{{samp(boss)}}} and {{{samp(urgent)}}}, but not
{{{samp(project1)}}}, or {{{samp(Kathy|Sally)}}} to find entries which
are tagged, like {{{samp(Kathy)}}} or {{{samp(Sally)}}}.  The full
syntax of the search string is rich and allows also matching against
TODO keywords, entry levels and properties.  For a complete description
with many examples, see [[Matching tags and properties]].

* Properties and columns
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: Storing information about an entry
  :ALT_TITLE: Properties and Columns
  :END:
#+cindex: properties

A property is a key-value pair associated with an entry.  Properties
can be set so they are associated with a single entry, with every
entry in a tree, or with every entry in an Org mode file.

There are two main applications for properties in Org mode.  First,
properties are like tags, but with a value.  Imagine maintaining a file
where you document bugs and plan releases for a piece of software.
Instead of using tags like ~:release_1:~, ~:release_2:~, you can use a
property, say ~:Release:~, that in different subtrees has different
values, such as ~1.0~ or ~2.0~.  Second, you can use properties to
implement (very basic) database capabilities in an Org buffer.  Imagine
keeping track of your music CDs, where properties could be things such
as the album, artist, date of release, number of tracks, and so on.

Properties can be conveniently edited and viewed in column view
(see [[Column view]]).

** Property syntax
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: How properties are spelled out
   :END:
#+cindex: property syntax
#+cindex: drawer, for properties

Properties are key-value pairs.  When they are associated with a single
entry or with a tree they need to be inserted into a special drawer
(see [[Drawers]]) with the name ~PROPERTIES~.  Each property is specified
on a single line, with the key (surrounded by colons) first, and the
value after it.  Here is an example:

#+begin_example
   ,* CD collection
   ,** Classic
   ,*** Goldberg Variations
   ,    :PROPERTIES:
   ,    :Title:     Goldberg Variations
   ,    :Composer:  J.S. Bach
   ,    :Artist:    Glen Gould
   ,    :Publisher: Deutsche Grammophon
   ,    :NDisks:    1
   ,    :END:
#+end_example

Depending on the value of ~org-use-property-inheritance~, a property
set this way will either be associated with a single entry, or the
sub-tree defined by the entry, see [[Property inheritance]].

You may define the allowed values for a particular property
{{{samp(:Xyz:)}}} by setting a property {{{samp(:Xyz_ALL:)}}}.  This
special property is /inherited/, so if you set it in a level 1 entry,
it will apply to the entire tree.  When allowed values are defined,
setting the corresponding property becomes easier and is less prone to
typing errors.  For the example with the CD collection, we can
predefine publishers and the number of disks in a box like this:

#+begin_example
   ,* CD collection
   ,  :PROPERTIES:
   ,  :NDisks_ALL:  1 2 3 4
   ,  :Publisher_ALL: "Deutsche Grammophon" Philips EMI
   ,  :END:
#+end_example

If you want to set properties that can be inherited by any entry in a
file, use a line like:

#+cindex: property, _ALL
#+cindex: #+PROPERTY
#+begin_example
   ,#+PROPERTY: NDisks_ALL 1 2 3 4
#+end_example

If you want to add to the value of an existing property, append a ~+~
to the property name.  The following results in the property ~var~
having the value ``foo=1 bar=2''.

#+cindex: property, +
#+begin_example
   ,#+PROPERTY: var  foo=1
   ,#+PROPERTY: var+ bar=2
#+end_example

It is also possible to add to the values of inherited properties.  The
following results in the ~genres~ property having the value ``Classic
Baroque'' under the ~Goldberg Variations~ subtree.

#+cindex: property, +
#+begin_example
   ,* CD collection
   ,** Classic
   ,    :PROPERTIES:
   ,    :GENRES: Classic
   ,    :END:
   ,*** Goldberg Variations
   ,    :PROPERTIES:
   ,    :Title:     Goldberg Variations
   ,    :Composer:  J.S. Bach
   ,    :Artist:    Glen Gould
   ,    :Publisher: Deutsche Grammophon
   ,    :NDisks:    1
   ,    :GENRES+:   Baroque
   ,    :END:
#+end_example
Note that a property can only have one entry per Drawer.

#+vindex: org-global-properties

Property values set with the global variable ~org-global-properties~
can be inherited by all entries in all Org files.

{{{noindent}}}
The following commands help to work with properties:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbdkey(M-,TAB)}}}, ~pcomplete~ ::
  #+kindex: M-@key{TAB}

  After an initial colon in a line, complete property keys.  All keys
  used in the current file will be offered as possible completions.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-x p)}}}, ~org-set-property~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x p

  Set a property.  This prompts for a property name and a value.  If
  necessary, the property drawer is created as well.

- C-u M-x org-insert-drawer RET ::
  #+cindex: org-insert-drawer

  Insert a property drawer into the current entry.  The drawer will be
  inserted early in the entry, but after the lines with planning
  information like deadlines.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}}, ~org-property-action~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-c

  With the cursor in a property drawer, this executes property commands.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-c s)}}}, ~org-set-property~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-c s

  Set a property in the current entry.  Both the property and the value
  can be inserted using completion.

- {{{kbdkey(S-,right)}}} {{{kbdkey(S-,left)}}}, ~org-property-next-allowed-value~ ~org-property-previous-allowed-value~ ::
  #+kindex: S-@key{right}

  Switch property at point to the next/previous allowed value.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-c d)}}}, ~org-delete-property~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-c d

  Remove a property from the current entry.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-c D)}}}, ~org-delete-property-globally~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-c D

  Globally remove a property, from all entries in the current file.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-c c)}}}, ~org-compute-property-at-point~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-c c

  Compute the property at point, using the operator and scope from the
  nearest column format definition.

** Special properties
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Access to other Org mode features
   :END:
#+cindex: properties, special

Special properties provide an alternative access method to Org mode
features, like the TODO state or the priority of an entry, discussed
in the previous chapters.  This interface exists so that you can
include these states in a column view (see [[Column view]]), or to use
them in queries.  The following property names are special and (except
for ~:CATEGORY:~) should not be used as keys in the properties drawer:

#+cindex: property, special, ID
#+cindex: property, special, TODO
#+cindex: property, special, TAGS
#+cindex: property, special, ALLTAGS
#+cindex: property, special, CATEGORY
#+cindex: property, special, PRIORITY
#+cindex: property, special, DEADLINE
#+cindex: property, special, SCHEDULED
#+cindex: property, special, CLOSED
#+cindex: property, special, TIMESTAMP
#+cindex: property, special, TIMESTAMP_IA
#+cindex: property, special, CLOCKSUM
#+cindex: property, special, CLOCKSUM_T
#+cindex: property, special, BLOCKED
# guessing that ITEM is needed in this area; also, should this list be sorted?
#+cindex: property, special, ITEM
#+cindex: property, special, FILE

#+attr_texinfo: :columns 0.3 0.7
| ID           | A globally unique ID used for synchronization during           |
|              | iCalendar or MobileOrg export.                                 |
| TODO         | The TODO keyword of the entry.                                 |
| TAGS         | The tags defined directly in the headline.                     |
| ALLTAGS      | All tags, including inherited ones.                            |
| CATEGORY     | The category of an entry.                                      |
| PRIORITY     | The priority of the entry, a string with a single letter.      |
| DEADLINE     | The deadline time string, without the angular brackets.        |
| SCHEDULED    | The scheduling timestamp, without the angular brackets.        |
| CLOSED       | When was this entry closed?                                    |
| TIMESTAMP    | The first keyword-less timestamp in the entry.                 |
| TIMESTAMP_IA | The first inactive timestamp in the entry.                     |
| CLOCKSUM     | The sum of CLOCK intervals in the subtree.  ~org-clock-sum~    |
|              | must be run first to compute the values in the current buffer. |
| CLOCKSUM_T   | The sum of CLOCK intervals in the subtree for today.           |
|              | ~org-clock-sum-today~ must be run first to compute the         |
|              | values in the current buffer.                                  |
| BLOCKED      | "t" if task is currently blocked by children or siblings       |
| ITEM         | The headline of the entry.                                     |
| FILE         | The filename the entry is located in.                          |

** Property searches
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Matching property values
   :END:
#+cindex: properties, searching
#+cindex: searching, of properties

To create sparse trees and special lists with selection based on properties,
the same commands are used as for tag searches (see [[Tag searches]]).

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c / m)}}}, ~C-c \~ ~org-match-sparse-tree~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c / m

  Create a sparse tree with all matching entries.  With a {{{kbd(C-u)}}}
  prefix argument, ignore headlines that are not a TODO line.

- {{{kbd(C-c a m)}}}, ~org-tags-view~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c a m

  Create a global list of tag/property matches from all agenda files.
  See [[Matching tags and properties]].

- {{{kbd(C-c a M)}}}, ~org-tags-view~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c a M
  #+vindex: org-tags-match-list-sublevels

  Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files, but check
  only TODO items and force checking of subitems (see variable
  ~org-tags-match-list-sublevels~).


The syntax for the search string is described in [[Matching tags and
properties]].

There is also a special command for creating sparse trees based on a
single property:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c / p)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c / p

  Create a sparse tree based on the value of a property.  This first
  prompts for the name of a property, and then for a value.  A sparse
  tree is created with all entries that define this property with the
  given value.  If you enclose the value in curly braces, it is
  interpreted as a regular expression and matched against the property
  values.

** Property inheritance
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Passing values down a tree
   :END:
#+cindex: properties, inheritance
#+cindex: inheritance, of properties

#+vindex: org-use-property-inheritance

The outline structure of Org mode documents lends itself to an
inheritance model of properties: if the parent in a tree has a certain
property, the children can inherit this property.  Org mode does not
turn this on by default, because it can slow down property searches
significantly and is often not needed.  However, if you find
inheritance useful, you can turn it on by setting the variable
~org-use-property-inheritance~.  It may be set to ~t~ to make all
properties inherited from the parent, to a list of properties that
should be inherited, or to a regular expression that matches inherited
properties.  If a property has the value {{{samp(nil)}}}, this is
interpreted as an explicit undefine of the property, so that
inheritance search will stop at this value and return ~nil~.

Org mode has a few properties for which inheritance is hard-coded, at
least for the special applications for which they are used:


#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~COLUMNS~ ::
  #+cindex: property, COLUMNS

  The ~:COLUMNS:~ property defines the format of column view (see [[Column
  view]]).  It is inherited in the sense that the level where a ~:COLUMNS:~
  property is defined is used as the starting point for a column view
  table, independently of the location in the subtree from where columns
  view is turned on.

- ~CATEGORY~ ::
  #+cindex: property, CATEGORY

  For agenda view, a category set through a ~:CATEGORY:~ property
  applies to the entire subtree.

- ~ARCHIVE~ ::
  #+cindex: property, ARCHIVE

  For archiving, the ~:ARCHIVE:~ property may define the archive
  location for the entire subtree (see [[Moving subtrees]]).

- ~LOGGING~ ::
  #+cindex: property, LOGGING

  The LOGGING property may define logging settings for an entry or a
  subtree (see [[Tracking TODO state changes]]).

** Column view
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Tabular viewing and editing
   :END:

A great way to view and edit properties in an outline tree is /column
view/.  In column view, each outline node is turned into a table row.
Columns in this table provide access to properties of the entries.  Org
mode implements columns by overlaying a tabular structure over the
headline of each item.  While the headlines have been turned into a
table row, you can still change the visibility of the outline tree.
For example, you get a compact table by switching to CONTENTS view
({{{kbdkey(S-,TAB)}}}} {{{kbdkey(S-,TAB)}}}), or simply {{{kbd(c)}}} while
column view is active), but you can still open, read, and edit the
entry below each headline.  Or, you can switch to column view after
executing a sparse tree command and in this way get a table only for
the selected items.  Column view also works in agenda buffers (see
[[Agenda views]]) where queries have collected selected items, possibly
from a number of files.

*** Defining columns
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: The COLUMNS format property
    :END:
#+cindex: column view, for properties
#+cindex: properties, column view

Setting up a column view first requires defining the columns.  This is
done by defining a column format line.

**** Scope of column definitions
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Where defined, where valid?
     :END:

To define a column format for an entire file, use a line like:

#+cindex: #+COLUMNS
#+begin_example
   ,#+COLUMNS: %25ITEM %TAGS %PRIORITY %TODO
#+end_example

To specify a format that only applies to a specific tree, add a
~:COLUMNS:~ property to the top node of that tree, for example:

#+begin_example
   ,** Top node for columns view
   ,   :PROPERTIES:
   ,   :COLUMNS: %25ITEM %TAGS %PRIORITY %TODO
   ,   :END:
#+end_example

If a ~:COLUMNS:~ property is present in an entry, it defines columns
for the entry itself, and for the entire subtree below it.  Since the
column definition is part of the hierarchical structure of the
document, you can define columns on level 1 that are general enough
for all sublevels, and more specific columns further down, when you
edit a deeper part of the tree.

**** Column attributes
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Appearance and content of a column
     :END:
A column definition sets the attributes of a column.  The general
definition looks like this:

  %[{{{var(width)}}}]{{{var(property)}}}[({{{var(title)}}})][{{{{var(summary-type)}}}}]

{{{noindent}}} Except for the percent sign and the property name, all
items are optional.  The individual parts have the following meaning:

#+attr_texinfo: :columns 0.2 0.8
| Variable                | Meaning                                                      |
|-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------|
| {{{var(width)}}}        | An integer specifying the width of the column in characters. |
|                         | If omitted, the width will be determined automatically.      |
| {{{var(property)}}}     | The property that should be edited in this column.           |
|                         | Special properties representing meta data are allowed here   |
|                         | as well (see [[Special properties]])                         |
| {{{var(title)}}}        | The header text for the column.  If omitted, the property    |
|                         | name is used.                                                |
| {{{var(summary-type)}}} | The summary type.  If specified, the column values for       |
|                         | parent nodes are computed from the children.                 |

{{{noindent}}} Supported summary types are:

#+attr_texinfo: :columns 0.2 0.8
| Type     | Meaning                                                               |
|----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~+~      | Sum numbers in this column.                                           |
| ~+;%.1f~ | Like ~+~, but format result with {{{samp(%.1f)}}}.                    |
| ~$~      | Currency, short for {{{samp(+;%.2f)}}}.                               |
| ~:~      | Sum times, HH:MM, plain numbers are hours.                            |
| ~X~      | Checkbox status, {{{samp([X])}}} if all children are {{{samp([X])}}}. |
| ~X/~     | Checkbox status, {{{samp([n/m])}}}.                                   |
| ~X%~     | Checkbox status, {{{samp([n%])}}}.                                    |
| ~min~    | Smallest number in column.                                            |
| ~max~    | Largest number.                                                       |
| ~mean~   | Arithmetic mean of numbers.                                           |
| ~:min~   | Smallest time value in column.                                        |
| ~:max~   | Largest time value.                                                   |
| ~:mean~  | Arithmetic mean of time values.                                       |
| ~@min~   | Minimum age (in days/hours/mins/seconds).                             |
| ~@max~   | Maximum age (in days/hours/mins/seconds).                             |
| ~@mean~  | Arithmetic mean of ages (in days/hours/mins/seconds).                 |
| ~est+~   | Add low-high estimates.                                               |


{{{noindent}}} Be aware that you can only have one summary type for
any property you include.  Subsequent columns referencing the same
property will all display the same summary information.

The ~est+~ summary type requires further explanation.  It is used for
combining estimates, expressed as low-high ranges.  For example,
instead of estimating a particular task will take 5 days, you might
estimate it as 5-6 days if you're fairly confident you know how much
work is required, or 1-10 days if you don't really know what needs to
be done.  Both ranges average at 5.5 days, but the first represents a
more predictable delivery.

When combining a set of such estimates, simply adding the lows and
highs produces an unrealistically wide result.  Instead, ~est+~ adds
the statistical mean and variance of the sub-tasks, generating a final
estimate from the sum.  For example, suppose you had ten tasks, each of
which was estimated at 0.5 to 2 days of work.  Straight addition
produces an estimate of 5 to 20 days, representing what to expect if
everything goes either extremely well or extremely poorly.  In
contrast, ~est+~ estimates the full job more realistically, at 10-15
days.

Here is an example for a complete columns definition, along with allowed
values.[fn:58]

#+begin_example
   :COLUMNS:  %25ITEM %9Approved(Approved?){X} %Owner %11Status \
                      %10Time_Estimate{:} %CLOCKSUM %CLOCKSUM_T
   :Owner_ALL:    Tammy Mark Karl Lisa Don
   :Status_ALL:   "In progress" "Not started yet" "Finished" ""
   :Approved_ALL: "[ ]" "[X]"
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} The first column, {{{samp(%25ITEM)}}}, means the first
25 characters of the item itself, i.e., of the headline.  You probably
always should start the column definition with the {{{samp(ITEM)}}}
specifier.  The other specifiers create columns {{{samp(Owner)}}} with
a list of names as allowed values, for {{{samp(Status)}}} with four
different possible values, and for a checkbox field
{{{samp(Approved)}}}.  When no width is given after the {{{samp(%)}}}
character, the column will be exactly as wide as it needs to be in
order to fully display all values.  The {{{samp(Approved)}}} column
does have a modified title ({{{samp(Approved?)}}}, with a question
mark).  Summaries will be created for the {{{samp(Time_Estimate)}}}
column by adding time duration expressions like HH:MM, and for the
{{{samp(Approved)}}} column, by providing an {{{samp([X])}}} status if
all children have been checked.  The {{{samp(CLOCKSUM)}}} and
{{{samp(CLOCKSUM_T)}}} columns are special, they lists the sums of
CLOCK intervals in the subtree, either for all clocks or just for
today.

*** Using column view
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How to create and use column view
    :END:

The following commands turn column view on or off:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-c)}}}, ~org-columns~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x C-c
  #+vindex: org-columns-default-format

  Turn on column view.  If the cursor is before the first headline in the
  file, column view is turned on for the entire file, using the
  ~#+COLUMNS~ definition.  If the cursor is somewhere inside the outline,
  this command searches the hierarchy, up from point, for a ~:COLUMNS:~
  property that defines a format.  When one is found, the column view
  table is established for the tree starting at the entry that contains
  the ~:COLUMNS:~ property.  If no such property is found, the format is
  taken from the ~#+COLUMNS~ line or from the variable
  ~org-columns-default-format~, and column view is established for the
  current entry and its subtree.

- {{{kbd(r)}}}, ~org-columns-redo~ ::
  #+kindex: r

  Recreate the column view, to include recent changes made in the
  buffer.

- {{{kbd(g)}}}, ~org-columns-redo~ ::
  #+kindex: g

  Same as {{{kbd(r)}}}.

- {{{kbd(q)}}}, ~org-columns-quit~ ::
  #+kindex: q

  Exit column view.

The following commands let you edit information in column view:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{key(left)}}} {{{key(right)}}} {{{key(up)}}} {{{key(down)}}} ::

  Move through the column view from field to field.

-  {{{kbdkey(S-,left)}}} {{{kbdkey(S-,right)}}} ::
  #+kindex: S-@key{left}
  #+kindex: S-@key{right}

  Switch to the next/previous allowed value of the field.  For this, you
  have to have specified allowed values for a property.

- {{{kbd(1..9\,0)}}} ::
  #+kindex: 1..9,0

  Directly select the Nth allowed value, {{{kbd(0)}}} selects the 10th
  value.

- {{{kbd(n)}}} {{{kbd(p)}}}, ~org-columns-next-allowed-value~ ~org-columns-previous-allowed-value~ ::
  #+kindex: n

  Same as {{{kbdkey(S-,left)}}} {{{kbdkey(S-,right)}}}

- {{{kbd(e)}}}, ~org-columns-edit-value~ ::
  #+kindex: e

  Edit the property at point.  For the special properties, this will
  invoke the same interface that you normally use to change that
  property.  For example, when editing a TAGS property, the tag
  completion or fast selection interface will pop up.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}}, ~org-columns-set-tags-or-toggle~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-c

  When there is a checkbox at point, toggle it.

- {{{kbd(v)}}}, ~org-columns-show-value~ ::
  #+kindex: v

  View the full value of this property.  This is useful if the width of
  the column is smaller than that of the value.

- {{{kbd(a)}}}, ~org-columns-edit-allowed~ ::
  #+kindex: a

  Edit the list of allowed values for this property.  If the list is found
  in the hierarchy, the modified values is stored there.  If no list is
  found, the new value is stored in the first entry that is part of the
  current column view.


The following commands modify column view on-the-fly:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(<)}}} {{{kbd(>)}}}, ~org-columns-narrow~ ~org-columns-widen~ ::
  #+kindex: <

  Make the column narrower/wider by one character.

- {{{kbdkey(S-M-,right)}}}, ~org-columns-new~ ::
  #+kindex: S-M-@key{right}

  Insert a new column, to the left of the current column.

*** Capturing column view
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: A dynamic block for column view
    :END:

Since column view is just an overlay over a buffer, it cannot be
exported or printed directly.  If you want to capture a column view,
use a ~columnview~ dynamic block (see [[Dynamic blocks]]).  The frame of
this block looks like this:

#+cindex: #+BEGIN, columnview
#+begin_example
   ,* The column view
   ,#+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id "label"

   ,#+END:
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} This dynamic block has the following parameters:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~:id~ ::

  This is the most important parameter.  Column view is a feature that is
  often localized to a certain (sub)tree, and the capture block might be
  at a different location in the file.  To identify the tree whose view
  to capture, you can use 4 values:

  #+cindex: property, ID
  #+attr_texinfo: :columns 0.35 0.65
  | Value               | Meaning                                                       |
  |---------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
  | local               | Use the tree in which the capture block is located.           |
  | global              | Make a global view, including all headings in the file.       |
  | =file:PATH-TO-FILE= | Run column view at the top of this file.                      |
  | ID                  | Call column view in the tree that has an ~:ID:~               |
  |                     | property with the value /label/.  You can use                 |
  |                     | {{{kbd(M-x org-id-copy)}}} to create a globally unique ID for |
  |                     | the current entry and copy it to the kill-ring.               |

  - local ::
    
    Use the tree in which the capture block is located.

  - global :: 

    Make a global view, including all headings in the file.

  - =file:PATH-TO-FILE= ::
    
    Run column view at the top of this file.

  - ID :: 
    
    Call column view in the tree that has an ~:ID:~ property with the
    value /label/.  You can use {{{kbd(M-x org-id-copy)}}} to
    create a globally unique ID for the current entry and copy
    it to the kill-ring.

- ~:hlines~ ::

  When ~t~, insert an hline after every line.  When a number ~N~,
              insert an hline before each headline with level ~<=~
              {{{var(N)}}}.

- ~:vlines~ ::

  When set to ~t~, force column groups to get vertical lines.

- ~:maxlevel~ ::

  When set to a number, don't capture entries below this level.

- ~:skip-empty-rows~ ::

  When set to ~t~, skip rows where the only non-empty specifier of the
  column view is ~ITEM~.



{{{noindent}}} The following commands insert or update the dynamic
block:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-x i)}}}, ~org-insert-columns-dblock~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x i

  Insert a dynamic block capturing a column view.  You will be prompted
  for the scope or ID of the view.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-u)}}}, ~org-dblock-update~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-c

  Update dynamic block at point.  The cursor needs to be in the ~#+BEGIN~
  line of the dynamic block.

- {{{kbd(C-u C-c C-x C-u)}}}, ~org-update-all-dblocks~ ::
  #+kindex: C-u C-c C-x C-u

  Update all dynamic blocks (see [[Dynamic blocks]]).  This is useful if you
  have several clock table blocks, column-capturing blocks or other
  dynamic blocks in a buffer.


You can add formulas to the column view table and you may add plotting
instructions in front of the table---these will survive an update of the
block.  If there is a ~#+TBLFM:~ after the table, the table will
actually be recalculated automatically after an update.

An alternative way to capture and process property values into a table
is provided by Eric Schulte's {{{file(org-collector.el)}}} which is a
contributed package.[fn:59] It provides a general API to collect
properties from entries in a certain scope, and arbitrary Lisp
expressions to process these values before inserting them into a table
or a dynamic block.

** Property API
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Properties for Lisp programmers
   :END:
#+cindex: properties, API
#+cindex: API, for properties

There is a full API for accessing and changing properties.  This API
can be used by Emacs Lisp programs to work with properties and to
implement features based on them.  For more information see [[Using the
property API]].

* Dates and times
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: Making items useful for planning
  :ALT_TITLE: Dates and Times
  :END:
#+cindex: dates
#+cindex: times
#+cindex: timestamp
#+cindex: date stamp

To assist project planning, TODO items can be labeled with a date and/or
a time.  The specially formatted string carrying the date and time
information is called a /timestamp/ in Org mode.  This may be a
little confusing because timestamp is often used as indicating when
something was created or last changed.  However, in Org mode this term
is used in a much wider sense.

** Timestamps
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Assigning a time to a tree entry
   :TITLE:    Timestamps, deadlines, and scheduling
   :END:
#+cindex: timestamps
#+cindex: ranges, time
#+cindex: date stamps
#+cindex: deadlines
#+cindex: scheduling

A timestamp is a specification of a date (possibly with a time or a
range of times) in a special format, either ~<2003-09-16 Tue>~ or
~<2003-09-16 Tue 09:39>~ or ~<2003-09-16 Tue 12:00-12:30>~.[fn:60] A
timestamp can appear anywhere in the headline or body of an Org tree
entry.  Its presence causes entries to be shown on specific dates in
the agenda (see [[Weekly/daily agenda]]).  We distinguish:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- Plain timestamp; Event; Appointment ::
  #+cindex: timestamp
  #+cindex: appointment

  A simple timestamp just assigns a date/time to an item.  This is just
  like writing down an appointment or event in a paper agenda.  In the
  timeline and agenda displays, the headline of an entry associated with
  a plain timestamp will be shown exactly on that date.

  #+begin_example
     ,* Meet Peter at the movies
       <2006-11-01 Wed 19:15>
     ,* Discussion on climate change
       <2006-11-02 Thu 20:00-22:00>
  #+end_example

- Timestamp with repeater interval ::
  #+cindex: timestamp, with repeater interval

  A timestamp may contain a /repeater interval/, indicating that it
  applies not only on the given date, but again and again after a
  certain interval of N days (d), weeks (w), months (m), or years (y).
  The following will show up in the agenda every Wednesday:

  #+begin_example
     ,* Pick up Sam at school
       <2007-05-16 Wed 12:30 +1w>
  #+end_example

- Diary-style sexp entries ::

  For more complex date specifications, Org mode supports using the
  special sexp diary entries implemented in the Emacs calendar/diary
  package.[fn:61] For example, with optional time:

  #+begin_example
     ,* 22:00-23:00 The nerd meeting on every 2nd Thursday of the month
       <%%(org-float t 4 2)>
  #+end_example

- Time/Date range ::
  #+cindex: timerange
  #+cindex: date range

  Two timestamps connected by {{{samp(--)}}} denote a range.  The headline
  will be shown on the first and last day of the range, and on any dates
  that are displayed and fall in the range.  Here is an example:

  #+begin_example
     ,** Meeting in Amsterdam
        <2004-08-23 Mon>--<2004-08-26 Thu>
  #+end_example

- Inactive timestamp ::
  #+cindex: timestamp, inactive
  #+cindex: inactive timestamp

  Just like a plain timestamp, but with square brackets instead of
  angular ones.  These timestamps are inactive in the sense that they do
  /not/ trigger an entry to show up in the agenda.

  #+begin_example
     ,* Gillian comes late for the fifth time
       [2006-11-01 Wed]
  #+end_example

** Creating timestamps
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Commands to insert timestamps
   :END:
For Org mode to recognize timestamps, they need to be in the specific
format.  All commands listed below produce timestamps in the correct
format.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c .)}}}, ~org-time-stamp~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c .

  Prompt for a date and insert a corresponding timestamp.  When the
  cursor is at an existing timestamp in the buffer, the command is used
  to modify this timestamp instead of inserting a new one.  When this
  command is used twice in succession, a time range is inserted.

- {{{kbd(C-c !)}}}, ~org-time-stamp-inactive~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c !

  Like {{{kbd(C-c .)}}}, but insert an inactive timestamp that will not
  cause an agenda entry.

- {{{kbd(C-u C-c .)}}} {{{kbd(C-u C-c !)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-u C-c .
  #+kindex: C-u C-c .
  #+kindex: C-u C-c !
  #+vindex: org-time-stamp-rounding-minutes

  Like {{{kbd(C-c .)}}} and {{{kbd(C-c !)}}}, but use the alternative
  format which contains date and time.  The default time can be rounded
  to multiples of 5 minutes, see the option
  ~org-time-stamp-rounding-minutes~.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-c

  Normalize timestamp, insert/fix day name if missing or wrong.

- {{{kbd(C-c <)}}}, ~org-date-from-calendar~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c <

  Insert a timestamp corresponding to the cursor date in the Calendar.

- {{{kbd(C-c >)}}}, ~org-goto-calendar~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c >

  Access the Emacs calendar for the current date.  If there is a
  timestamp in the current line, go to the corresponding date instead.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-o)}}}, ~org-open-at-point~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-o

  Access the agenda for the date given by the timestamp or -range at
  point (see [[Weekly/daily agenda]]).

- {{{kbdkey(S-,left)}}} {{{kbdkey(S-,right)}}}, ~org-timestamp-down-day~ ~org-timestamp-up-day~ ::
  #+kindex: S-@key{left}

  Change date at cursor by one day.  These key bindings conflict with
  shift-selection and related modes (see [[Conflicts]]).

- {{{kbdkey(S-,up)}}} {{{kbdkey(S-,down)}}}, ~org-timestamp-up~ ~org-timestamp-down-down~ ::
  #+kindex: S-@key{up}

  Change the item under the cursor in a timestamp.  The cursor can be on
  a year, month, day, hour or minute.  When the timestamp contains a time
  range like {{{samp(15:30-16:30)}}}, modifying the first time will also
  shift the second, shifting the time block with constant length.  To
  change the length, modify the second time.  Note that if the cursor is
  in a headline and not at a timestamp, these same keys modify the
  priority of an item.  (see [[Priorities]]).  The key bindings also conflict
  with shift-selection and related modes (see [[Conflicts]]).

- {{{kbd(C-c C-y)}}}, ~org-evaluate-time-range~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-y
  #+cindex: evaluate time range

  Evaluate a time range by computing the difference between start and
  end.  With a prefix argument, insert result after the time range (in a
  table: into the following column).

*** The date/time prompt

    :END:
#+cindex: date, reading in minibuffer
#+cindex: time, reading in minibuffer

#+vindex: org-read-date-prefer-future

When Org mode prompts for a date/time, the default is shown in default
date/time format, and the prompt therefore seems to ask for a specific
format.  But it will in fact accept date/time information in a variety
of formats.  Generally, the information should start at the beginning
of the string.  Org mode will find whatever information is in there and
derive anything you have not specified from the /default date and
time/.  The default is usually the current date and time, but when
modifying an existing timestamp, or when entering the second stamp of
a range, it is taken from the stamp in the buffer.  When filling in
information, Org mode assumes that most of the time you will want to
enter a date in the future: if you omit the month/year and the given
day/month is /before/ today, it will assume that you mean a future
date.[fn:62] If the date has been automatically shifted into the
future, the time prompt will show this with {{{samp((=>F))}}}.

For example, let's assume that today is *June 13, 2006*.  Here is how
various inputs will be interpreted, the items filled in by Org mode
are in *bold*.

| Input        | Interpretation                                       |
|--------------+------------------------------------------------------|
| 3-2-5        | {{{result}}} 2003-02-05                              |
| 2/5/3        | {{{result}}} 2003-02-05                              |
| 14           | {{{result}}} *2006*-*06*-14                          |

| 2/5          | {{{result}}} *2007*-02-05                            |
| Fri          | {{{result}}} nearest Friday (default date or later)  |
| sep 15       | {{{result}}} *2006*-09-15                            |
| feb 15       | {{{result}}} *2007*-02-15                            |
| sep 12 9     | {{{result}}} 2009-09-12                              |
| 12:45        | {{{result}}} *2006*-*06*-*13* 12:45                  |
| 22 sept 0:34 | {{{result}}} *2006*-09-22 0:34                       |
| w4           | {{{result}}} ISO week for of the current year *2006* |
| 2012 w4 fri  | {{{result}}} Friday of ISO week 4 in 2012            |
| 2012-w04-5   | {{{result}}} Same as above                           |


Furthermore you can specify a relative date by giving, as the /first/
thing in the input: a plus/minus sign, a number and a letter ([dwmy])
to indicate change in days, weeks, months, or years.  With a single
plus or minus, the date is always relative to today.  With a double
plus or minus, it is relative to the default date.  If instead of a
single letter, you use the abbreviation of day name, the date will be
the Nth such day, e.g.:

| Input | Interpretation                           |
|-------+------------------------------------------|
|    +0 | {{{result}}} today                       |
|     . | {{{result}}} today                       |
|   +4d | {{{result}}} four days from today        |
|    +4 | {{{result}}} same as +4d                 |
|   +2w | {{{result}}} two weeks from today        |
|   ++5 | {{{result}}} five days from default date |
| +2tue | {{{result}}} second Tuesday from now     |


#+vindex: parse-time-months
#+vindex: parse-time-weekdays

The function understands English month and weekday abbreviations.  If
you want to use unabbreviated names and/or other languages, configure
the variables ~parse-time-months~ and ~parse-time-weekdays~.

#+vindex: org-read-date-force-compatible-dates

Not all dates can be represented in a given Emacs implementation.  By
default Org mode forces dates into the compatibility range 1970--2037
which works on all Emacs implementations.  If you want to use dates
outside of this range, read the docstring of the variable
~org-read-date-force-compatible-dates~.

You can specify a time range by giving start and end times or by
giving a start time and a duration (in HH:MM format).  Use one or two
dash(es) as the separator in the former case and use '+' as the
separator in the latter case, e.g.:

| Range        | Result                     |
|--------------+----------------------------|
| 11am-1:15pm  | {{{result}}} 11:00-13:15   |
| 11am--1:15pm | {{{result}}} same as above |
| 11am+2:15    | {{{result}}} same as above |

#+cindex: calendar, for selecting date

Parallel to the minibuffer prompt, a calendar is popped up.[fn:63]
When you exit the date prompt, either by clicking on a date in the

calendar will be combined with the information entered at the prompt.
You can control the calendar fully from the minibuffer:

#+vindex: org-read-date-display-live

The actions of the date/time prompt may seem complex, but I assure you they
will grow on you, and you will start getting annoyed by pretty much any other
way of entering a date/time out there.  To help you understand what is going
on, the current interpretation of your input will be displayed live in the
minibuffer.[fn:64]

*** Custom time format

#+cindex: custom date/time format
#+cindex: time format, custom
#+cindex: date format, custom

#+vindex: org-display-custom-times
#+vindex: org-time-stamp-custom-formats

Org mode uses the standard ISO notation for dates and times as it is
defined in ISO 8601.  If you cannot get used to this and require
another representation of date and time to keep you happy, you can get
it by customizing the variables ~org-display-custom-times~ and
~org-time-stamp-custom-formats~.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-t)}}}, ~org-toggle-time-stamp-overlays~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x C-t

  Toggle the display of custom formats for dates and times.


{{{noindent}}}
Org mode needs the default format for scanning, so the custom date/time
format does not /replace/ the default format---instead it is put
/over/ the default format using text properties.  This has the
following consequences:


- You cannot place the cursor onto a timestamp anymore, only before or
  after.

- The {{{kbdkey(S-,up)}}} {{{kbdkey(S-,down)}}} keys can no longer be
  used to adjust each component of a timestamp.  If the cursor is at
  the beginning of the stamp, {{{kbdkey(S-,up)}}}
  {{{kbdkey(S-,down)}}} will change the stamp by one day, just like
  {{{kbdkey(S-,left)}}} {{{kbdkey(S-,right)}}}.  At the end of the
  stamp, the time will be changed by one minute.

-  If the timestamp contains a range of clock times or a repeater,
   these will not be overlaid, but remain in the buffer as they were.

-  When you delete a timestamp character-by-character, it will only
   disappear from the buffer after /all/ (invisible) characters
   belonging to the ISO timestamp have been removed.

- If the custom timestamp format is longer than the default and you
  are using dates in tables, table alignment will be messed up.  If
  the custom format is shorter, things do work as expected.

** Deadlines and scheduling
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Planning your work
   :END:

A timestamp may be preceded by special keywords to facilitate planning:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~DEADLINE~ ::
  #+cindex: DEADLINE keyword

  Meaning: the task (most likely a TODO item, though not necessarily) is
  supposed to be finished on that date.

  #+vindex: org-deadline-warning-days

  On the deadline date, the task will be listed in the agenda.  In
  addition, the agenda for /today/ will carry a warning about the
  approaching or missed deadline, starting ~org-deadline-warning-days~
  before the due date, and continuing until the entry is marked DONE.  An
  example:

  #+begin_example
     ,*** TODO write article about the Earth for the Guide
         DEADLINE: <2004-02-29 Sun>
         The editor in charge is [[bbdb:Ford Prefect]]
  #+end_example

  You can specify a different lead time for warnings for a specific
  deadlines using the following syntax.  Here is an example with a
  warning period of 5 days ~DEADLINE: <2004-02-29 Sun -5d>~.

- ~SCHEDULED~ ::
  #+cindex: SCHEDULED keyword

  Meaning: you are planning to start working on that task on the given
  date.

  #+vindex: org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done

  The headline will be listed under the given date.[fn:65] In addition,
  a reminder that the scheduled date has passed will be present in the
  compilation for /today/, until the entry is marked DONE, i.e., the
  task will automatically be forwarded until completed.

  #+begin_example
     ,*** TODO Call Trillian for a date on New Years Eve.
         SCHEDULED: <2004-12-25 Sat>
  #+end_example

  {{{noindent}}}
  *Important:* Scheduling an item in Org mode should /not/ be
  understood in the same way that we understand /scheduling a meeting/.
  Setting a date for a meeting is just a simple appointment, you should
  mark this entry with a simple plain timestamp, to get this item shown
  on the date where it applies.  This is a frequent misunderstanding by
  Org users.  In Org mode, /scheduling/ means setting a date when you
  want to start working on an action item.


You may use timestamps with repeaters in scheduling and deadline
entries.  Org mode will issue early and late warnings based on the
assumption that the timestamp represents the /nearest instance/ of
the repeater.  However, the use of diary sexp entries like

~<%%(org-float t 42)>~

in scheduling and deadline timestamps is limited.  Org mode does not
know enough about the internals of each sexp function to issue early and
late warnings.  However, it will show the item on each day where the
sexp entry matches.

*** Inserting deadline/schedule

  Insert {{{samp(DEADLINE)}}} keyword along with a stamp.  The insertion
  will happen in the line directly following the headline.  Any CLOSED
  timestamp will be removed.  When called with a prefix arg, an existing
  deadline will be removed from the entry.  Depending on the variable
  ~org-log-redeadline~, a note will be taken when changing an existing
  deadline.[fn:67]

- {{{kbd(C-c C-s)}}}, ~org-schedule~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-s

  Insert {{{samp(SCHEDULED)}}} keyword along with a stamp.  The insertion
  will happen in the line directly following the headline.  Any
  {{{samp(CLOSED)}}} timestamp will be removed.  When called with a
  prefix argument, remove the scheduling date from the entry.  Depending
  on the variable ~org-log-reschedule~, a note will be taken when
  changing an existing scheduling time.[fn:68]

- {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-k)}}}, ~org-mark-entry-for-agenda-action~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x C-k
  #+kindex: k a
  #+kindex: k s

  Mark the current entry for agenda action.  After you have marked the
  entry like this, you can open the agenda or the calendar to find an
  appropriate date.  With the cursor on the selected date, press 
  {{{kbd(k s)}}} or {{{kbd(k d)}}} to schedule the marked item.

- {{{kbd(C-c / d)}}}, ~org-check-deadlines~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c / d
  #+cindex: sparse tree, for deadlines
  #+vindex: org-deadline-warning-days

  Create a sparse tree with all deadlines that are either past-due, or
  which will become due within ~org-deadline-warning-days~.  With
  {{{kbd(C-u)}}} prefix, show all deadlines in the file.  With a numeric
  prefix, check that many days.  For example, {{{kbd(C-1 C-c / d)}}}
  shows all deadlines due tomorrow.

- {{{kbd(C-c / b)}}}, ~org-check-before-date~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c / b

  Sparse tree for deadlines and scheduled items before a given date.

- {{{kbd(C-c / a)}}}, ~org-check-after-date~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c / a
  
  Sparse tree for deadlines and scheduled items after a given date.


Note that ~org-schedule~ and ~org-deadline~ supports setting the date
by indicating a relative time: e.g.  +1d will set the date to the next
day after today, and --1w will set the date to the previous week
before any current timestamp.

*** Repeated tasks
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Items that show up again and again
    :END:
#+cindex: tasks, repeated
#+cindex: repeated tasks

Some tasks need to be repeated again and again.  Org mode helps to
organize such tasks using a so-called repeater in a DEADLINE, SCHEDULED,
or plain timestamp.  In the following example:

#+begin_example
   ,** TODO Pay the rent
      DEADLINE: <2005-10-01 Sat +1m>
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} the ~+1m~ is a repeater; the intended interpretation is
that the task has a deadline on <2005-10-01> and repeats itself every
(one) month starting from that time.  You can use yearly, monthly,
weekly, daily and hourly repeat cookies by using the ~y/w/m/d/h~
letters.  If you need both a repeater and a special warning period in a
deadline entry, the repeater should come first and the warning period
last: ~DEADLINE: <2005-10-01 Sat +1m -3d>~.

#+vindex: org-todo-repeat-to-state

Deadlines and scheduled items produce entries in the agenda when they
are over-due, so it is important to be able to mark such an entry as
completed once you have done so.  When you mark a DEADLINE or a
SCHEDULE with the TODO keyword DONE, it will no longer produce entries
in the agenda.  The problem with this is, however, that then also the
/next/ instance of the repeated entry will not be active.  Org mode
deals with this in the following way: When you try to mark such an
entry DONE (using {{{kbd(C-c C-t)}}}), it will shift the base date of
the repeating timestamp by the repeater interval, and immediately set
the entry state back to TODO.[fn:69] In the example above, setting the
state to DONE would actually switch the date like this:

#+begin_example
   ,** TODO Pay the rent
      DEADLINE: <2005-11-01 Tue +1m>
#+end_example

#+vindex: org-log-repeat

A timestamp will be added under the deadline, to keep a record that
you actually acted on the previous instance of this deadline.[fn:70]

As a consequence of shifting the base date, this entry will no longer be
visible in the agenda when checking past dates, but all future instances
will be visible.

With the {{{samp(+1m)}}} cookie, the date shift will always be exactly one
month.  So if you have not paid the rent for three months, marking this
entry DONE will still keep it as an overdue deadline.  Depending on the
task, this may not be the best way to handle it.  For example, if you
forgot to call your father for 3 weeks, it does not make sense to call
him 3 times in a single day to make up for it.  Finally, there are tasks
like changing batteries which should always repeat a certain time
/after/ the last time you did it.  For these tasks, Org mode has
special repeaters  {{{samp(++)}}} and {{{samp(.+)}}}.  For example:

#+begin_example
   ,** TODO Call Father
      DEADLINE: <2008-02-10 Sun ++1w>
      Marking this DONE will shift the date by at least one week,
      but also by as many weeks as it takes to get this date into
      the future.  However, it stays on a Sunday, even if you called
      and marked it done on Saturday.
   ,** TODO Check the batteries in the smoke detectors
      DEADLINE: <2005-11-01 Tue .+1m>
      Marking this DONE will shift the date to one month after
      today.
#+end_example

You may have both scheduling and deadline information for a specific
task---just make sure that the repeater intervals on both are the
same.

An alternative to using a repeater is to create a number of copies of
a task subtree, with dates shifted in each copy.  The command
{{{kbd(C-c C-x c)}}} was created for this purpose, it is described in
[[Structure editing]].

** Clocking work time
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Tracking how long you spend on a task
   :END:
#+cindex: clocking time
#+cindex: time clocking

Org mode allows you to clock the time you spend on specific tasks in a
project.  When you start working on an item, you can start the clock.  When
you stop working on that task, or when you mark the task done, the clock is
stopped and the corresponding time interval is recorded.  It also computes
the total time spent on each subtree of a project.[fn:71]  And it remembers a
history or tasks recently clocked, to that you can jump quickly between a
number of tasks absorbing your time.

To save the clock history across Emacs sessions, use:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-clock-persist 'history)
  (org-clock-persistence-insinuate)
#+end_src

When you clock into a new task after resuming Emacs, the incomplete
clock will be found (see [[Resolving idle time]]) and you will be prompted
about what to do with it.[fn:72]

*** Clocking commands
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Starting and stopping a clock
    :END:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-i)}}}, ~org-clock-in~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x C-i
  #+vindex: org-clock-into-drawer
  #+vindex: org-clock-continuously
  #+cindex: property, LOG_INTO_DRAWER

  Start the clock on the current item (clock-in).  This inserts the CLOCK
  keyword together with a timestamp.  If this is not the first clocking
  of this item, the multiple CLOCK lines will be wrapped into a
  ~:LOGBOOK:~ drawer (see also the variable ~org-clock-into-drawer~).
  You can also overrule the setting of this variable for a subtree by
  setting a ~CLOCK_INTO_DRAWER~ or ~LOG_INTO_DRAWER~ property.  When
  called with a {{{kbd(C-u)}}} prefix argument, select the task from a
  list of recently clocked tasks.  With two {{{kbd(C-u C-u)}}} prefixes,
  clock into the task at point and mark it as the default task; the
  default task will then always be available with letter {{{kbd(d)}}}
  when selecting a clocking task.  With three {{{kbd(C-u C-u C-u)}}}
  prefixes, force continuous clocking by starting the clock when the
  last clock stopped.@*

  #+cindex: property: CLOCK_MODELINE_TOTAL
  #+cindex: property: LAST_REPEAT
  #+vindex: org-clock-modeline-total

  While the clock is running, the current clocking time is shown in the
  mode line, along with the title of the task.  The clock time shown will
  be all time ever clocked for this task and its children.  If the task
  has an effort estimate (see [[Effort estimates]]), the mode line displays
  the current clocking time against it.[fn:73] If the task is a
  repeating one (see [[Repeated tasks]]), only the time since the last reset
  of the task will be shown.[fn:74] More control over what time is shown
  can be exercised with the ~CLOCK_MODELINE_TOTAL~ property.  It may have
  the values ~current~ to show only the current clocking instance,
  ~today~ to show all time clocked on this tasks today (see also the
  variable ~org-extend-today-until~), ~all~ to include all time, or
  ~auto~ which is the default.[fn:75]  Clicking with {{{kbd(mouse-1)}}}
  onto the mode line entry will pop up a menu with clocking options.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-o)}}}, ~org-clock-out~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x C-o
  #+vindex: org-log-note-clock-out

  Stop the clock (clock-out).  This inserts another timestamp at the same
  location where the clock was last started.  It also directly computes
  the resulting time in inserts it after the time range as
  {{{samp(=>HH:MM)}}}.  See the variable ~org-log-note-clock-out~ for the
  possibility to record an additional note together with the clock-out
  timestamp.[fn:76]

- {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-x)}}}, ~org-clock-in-last~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x C-x
  #+vindex: org-clock-continuously

  Reclock the last clocked task.  With one {{{kbd(C-u)}}} prefix
  argument, select the task from the clock history.  With two
  {{{kbd(C-u)}}} prefixes, force continuous clocking by starting the
  clock when the last clock stopped.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-e)}}}, ~org-clock-modify-effort-estimate~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x C-e

  Update the effort estimate for the current clock task.
- {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} {{{kbd(C-c C-y)}}}, ~org-evaluate-time-range~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-c
  #+kindex: C-c C-y
  #+kindex: C-c C-c

  Recompute the time interval after changing one of the timestamps.  This
  is only necessary if you edit the timestamps directly.  If you change
  them with {{{kbdkey(S-,cursor)}}} keys, the update is automatic.

- {{{kbdkey(C-S-,up)}}} {{{kbdkey(C-S-,down)}}}, ~org-clock-timestamps-up/down~ ::
  #+kindex: C-S-@key{up/down}

  On ~CLOCK~ log lines, increase/decrease both timestamps so that the
  clock duration keeps the same.

- {{{kbdkey(S-M-,up)}}} {{{kbdkey(S-M-,down)}}}, ~org-timestamp-up/down~ ::
  #+kindex: S-M-@key{up/down}

  On ~CLOCK~ log lines, increase/decrease the timestamp at point and the
  one of the previous (or the next clock) timestamp by the same
  duration.  For example, if you hit {{{kbdkey(S-M-,up)}}} to increase a
  clocked-out timestamp by five minutes, then the clocked-in timestamp
  of the next clock will be increased by five minutes.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-t)}}}, ~org-todo~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-t

  Changing the TODO state of an item to DONE automatically stops the
  clock if it is running in this same item.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-q)}}}, ~org-clock-cancel~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x C-q

  Cancel the current clock.  This is useful if a clock was started by
  mistake, or if you ended up working on something else.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-j)}}}, ~org-clock-goto~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x C-j

  Jump to the headline of the currently clocked in task.  With a
  {{{kbd(C-u)}}} prefix arg, select the target task from a list of
  recently clocked tasks.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-d)}}}, ~org-clock-display~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x C-d
  #+vindex: org-remove-highlights-with-change

  Display time summaries for each subtree in the current buffer.  This
  puts overlays at the end of each headline, showing the total time
  recorded under that heading, including the time of any subheadings.
  You can use visibility cycling to study the tree, but the overlays
  disappear when you change the buffer (see variable
  ~org-remove-highlights-with-change~) or press {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}}.


The {{{kbd(l)}}} key may be used in the timeline (see [[Timeline for a
single file]]) and in the agenda (see [[Weekly/daily agenda]]) to show which
tasks have been worked on or closed during a day.

*Important:* note that both ~org-clock-out~ and ~org-clock-in-last~
can have a global keybinding and will not modify the window
disposition.

*** The clock table
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Detailed reports
    :END:
#+cindex: clocktable, dynamic block
#+cindex: report, of clocked time

Org mode can produce quite complex reports based on the time clocking
information.  Such a report is called a /clock table/, because it is
formatted as one or several Org tables.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-r)}}}, ~org-clock-report~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x C-r

  Insert a dynamic block (see [[Dynamic blocks]]) containing a clock report
  as an Org mode table into the current file.  When the cursor is at an
  existing clock table, just update it.  When called with a prefix
  argument, jump to the first clock report in the current document and
  update it.  The clock table always includes also trees with ~:ARCHIVE:~
  tag.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-u)}}}, ~org-dblock-update~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-c

  Update dynamic block at point.  The cursor needs to be in the
  ~#+BEGIN~ line of the dynamic block.

- {{{kbd(C-u C-c C-x C-u)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-u C-c C-x C-u

  Update all dynamic blocks (see [[Dynamic blocks]]).  This is useful if you
  have several clock table blocks in a buffer.

- {{{kbdkey(S-,left)}}} {{{kbdkey(S-,right)}}}, ~org-clocktable-try-shift~ ::

  Shift the current ~:block~ interval and update the table.  The cursor
  needs to be in the ~#+BEGIN: clocktable~ line for this command.  If
  ~:block~ is ~today~, it will be shifted to ~today-1~ etc.


Here is an example of the frame for a clock table as it is inserted
into the buffer with the {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-r)}}} command:

#+cindex: #+BEGIN, clocktable
#+begin_example
   ,#+BEGIN: clocktable :maxlevel 2 :emphasize nil :scope file
   ,#+END: clocktable
#+end_example
{{{noindent}}}
#+vindex: org-clocktable-defaults
The {{{samp(BEGIN)}}} line and specify a number of options to define the scope,
structure, and formatting of the report.  Defaults for all these options can
be configured in the variable ~org-clocktable-defaults~.

{{{noindent}}} First there are options that determine which clock entries are to
be selected:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- :maxlevel ::    

  Maximum level depth to which times are listed in the table.  Clocks at
  deeper levels will be summed into the upper level.

- :scope ::      

  The scope to consider.  This can be any of the following:

  - nil ::        the current buffer or narrowed region
  - file ::      the full current buffer
  - subtree ::   the subtree where the clocktable is located
  - tree {{{var(N)}}} :: the surrounding level {{{var(N)}}} tree, for example ~tree3~
  - tree ::      the surrounding level 1 tree
  - agenda ::    all agenda files
  - ("file"..) :: scan these files
  - file-with-archives ::    current file and its archives
  - agenda-with-archives ::  all agenda files, including archives

- :block ::       

  The time block to consider.  This block is specified either absolute,
  or relative to the current time and may be any of these formats:

  - 2007-12-31 ::   New year eve 2007
  - 2007-12 ::      December 2007
  - 2007-W50 ::     ISO-week 50 in 2007
  - 2007-Q2 ::      2nd quarter in 2007
  - 2007 ::         the year 2007
  - today, yesterday, today-{{{var(N)}}} ::          a relative day
  - thisweek, lastweek, thisweek-{{{var(N)}}} ::     a relative week
  - thismonth, lastmonth, thismonth-{{{var(N)}}} ::  a relative month
  - thisyear, lastyear, thisyear-{{{var(N)}}} ::     a relative year

  Use {{{kbdkey(S-,left)}}} or {{{kbdkey(S-,right)}}} to shift the
  time interval.

- :tstart ::     

  A time string specifying when to start considering times.

- :tend  ::       

  A time string specifying when to stop considering times.

- :step  ::  

  Set to ~week~ or ~day~ to split the table into chunks.  To use this,
  ~:block~ or ~:tstart~, ~:tend~ are needed.

- :stepskip0 ::   

  Do not show steps that have zero time.

- :fileskip0 ::  

  Do not show table sections from files which did not contribute.

- :tags ::        

  A tags match to select entries that should contribute.  See [[Matching
  tags and properties]] for the match syntax.


Then there are options which determine the formatting of the table.  There
options are interpreted by the function ~org-clocktable-write-default~,
but you can specify your own function using the ~:formatter~ parameter.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- :emphasize ::   

  When ~t~, emphasize level one and level two items.

- :lang ::        

  Language to use for descriptive cells like "Task".[fn:77]

- :link ::       

  Link the item headlines in the table to their origins.

- :narrow ::     

  An integer to limit the width of the headline column in the org table.
  If you write it like {{{samp(50!)}}}, then the headline will also be
  shortened in export.

- :indent  ::    

  Indent each headline field according to its level.

- :tcolumns ::   

  Number of columns to be used for times.  If this is smaller than
  ~:maxlevel~, lower levels will be lumped into one column.

- :level ::      

  Should a level number column be included?

- :compact ::    

  Abbreviation for ~:level nil :indent t :narrow 40! :tcolumns 1~.  All
  are overwritten except if there is an explicit ~:narrow~.

- :timestamp ::  

  A timestamp for the entry, when available.  Look for SCHEDULED,
  DEADLINE, TIMESTAMP and TIMESTAMP_IA, in this order.

- :properties :: 

  List of properties that should be shown in the table.  Each property
  will get its own column.

- :inherit-props :: 

  When this flag is ~t~, the values for ~:properties~ will be inherited.

- :formula  ::   

  Content of a ~#+TBLFM~ line to be added and evaluated.  As a special
  case, {{{samp(:formula %)}}} adds a column with % time.  If you do not
  specify a formula here, any existing formula below the clock table
  will survive updates and be evaluated.

- :formatter ::  

  A function to format clock data and insert it into the buffer.


To get a clock summary of the current level 1 tree, for the current
day, you could write:

#+begin_example
   ,#+BEGIN: clocktable :maxlevel 2 :block today :scope tree1 :link t
   ,#+END: clocktable
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} To use a specific time range you could write:[fn:78]

#+begin_example
   ,#+BEGIN: clocktable :tstart "<2006-08-10 Thu 10:00>"
                       :tend "<2006-08-10 Thu 12:00>"
   ,#+END: clocktable
#+end_example

A summary of the current subtree with % times would be:

#+begin_example
   ,#+BEGIN: clocktable :scope subtree :link t :formula %
   ,#+END: clocktable
#+end_example

A horizontally compact representation of everything clocked during
last week would be:

#+begin_example
   ,#+BEGIN: clocktable :scope agenda :block lastweek :compact t
   ,#+END: clocktable
#+end_example

*** Resolving idle time
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Resolving time when you've been idle
    :TITLE:    Resolving idle time and continuous clocking
    :END:

#+cindex: resolve idle time
#+cindex: idle, resolve, dangling

If you clock in on a work item, and then walk away from your
computer---perhaps to take a phone call---you often need to
``resolve'' the time you were away by either subtracting it from the
current clock, or applying it to another one.

#+vindex: org-clock-idle-time

By customizing the variable ~org-clock-idle-time~ to some integer,
such as 10 or 15, Emacs can alert you when you get back to your
computer after being idle for that many minutes, and ask what you want
to do with the idle time.[fn:79] There will be a question waiting for you
when you get back, indicating how much idle time has passed
(constantly updated with the current amount), as well as a set of
choices to correct the discrepancy:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(k)}}} ::
  #+kindex: k

  To keep some or all of the minutes and stay clocked in, press
  {{{kbd(k)}}}.  Org will ask how many of the minutes to keep.  Press
  {{{key(RET)}}} to keep them all, effectively changing nothing, or
  enter a number to keep that many minutes.

- {{{kbd(K)}}} ::
  #+kindex: K

  If you use the shift key and press {{{kbd(K)}}}, it will keep however
  many minutes you request and then immediately clock out of that task.
  If you keep all of the minutes, this is the same as just clocking out
  of the current task.

- {{{kbd(s)}}} ::
  #+kindex: s

  To keep none of the minutes, use {{{kbd(s)}}} to subtract all the away
  time from the clock, and then check back in from the moment you
  returned.

- {{{kbd(S)}}} ::
  #+kindex: S

  To keep none of the minutes and just clock out at the start of the
  away time, use the shift key and press {{{kbd(S)}}}.  Remember that
  using shift will always leave you clocked out, no matter which option
  you choose.

- {{{kbd(C)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C

  To cancel the clock altogether, use {{{kbd(C)}}}.  Note that if instead
  of canceling you subtract the away time, and the resulting clock
  amount is less than a minute, the clock will still be canceled rather
  than clutter up the log with an empty entry.


What if you subtracted those away minutes from the current clock, and
now want to apply them to a new clock? Simply clock in to any task
immediately after the subtraction.  Org will notice that you have
subtracted time ``on the books'', so to speak, and will ask if you
want to apply those minutes to the next task you clock in on.

There is one other instance when this clock resolution magic occurs.
Say you were clocked in and hacking away, and suddenly your cat chased
a mouse who scared a hamster that crashed into your UPS's power
button! You suddenly lose all your buffers, but thanks to auto-save
you still have your recent Org mode changes, including your last clock
in.

If you restart Emacs and clock into any task, Org will notice that you
have a dangling clock which was never clocked out from your last
session.  Using that clock's starting time as the beginning of the
unaccounted-for period, Org will ask how you want to resolve that
time.  The logic and behavior is identical to dealing with away time
due to idleness; it is just happening due to a recovery event rather
than a set amount of idle time.

You can also check all the files visited by your Org agenda for
dangling clocks at any time using {{{kbd(M-x org-resolve-clocks RET)}}}
 (or {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-z)}}}).

*** Continuous clocking
#+cindex: continuous clocking
#+vindex: org-clock-continuously

You may want to start clocking from the time when you clocked out the
previous task.  To enable this systematically, set
~org-clock-continuously~ to ~t~.  Each time you clock in, Org retrieves
the clock-out time of the last clocked entry for this session, and
start the new clock from there.

If you only want this from time to time, use three universal prefix
arguments with ~org-clock-in~ and two {{{kbd(C-u C-u)}}} with
~org-clock-in-last~.

** Effort estimates
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Planning work effort in advance
   :END:
#+cindex: effort estimates
#+cindex: property, Effort
#+vindex: org-effort-property

If you want to plan your work in a very detailed way, or if you need
to produce offers with quotations of the estimated work effort, you
may want to assign effort estimates to entries.  If you are also
clocking your work, you may later want to compare the planned effort
with the actual working time, a great way to improve planning
estimates.  Effort estimates are stored in a special property
{{{samp(Effort)}}}.[fn:80] You can set the effort for an entry with
the following commands:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @kbd
- {{{kbd(C-c C-x e)}}}, ~org-set-effort~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x e

  Set the effort estimate for the current entry.  With a numeric prefix
  argument, set it to the Nth allowed value (see below).  This command is
  also accessible from the agenda with the {{{kbd(e)}}} key.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-e)}}}, ~org-clock-modify-effort-estimate~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x C-e

  Modify the effort estimate of the item currently being clocked.


Clearly the best way to work with effort estimates is through column
view (see [[Column view]]).  You should start by setting up discrete values
for effort estimates, and a ~COLUMNS~ format that displays these
values together with clock sums (if you want to clock your time).  For
a specific buffer you can use:

#+begin_example
   ,#+PROPERTY: Effort_ALL 0 0:10 0:30 1:00 2:00 3:00 4:00 5:00 6:00 7:00
   ,#+COLUMNS: %40ITEM(Task) %17Effort(Estimated Effort){:} %CLOCKSUM
#+end_example

#+vindex: org-global-properties
#+vindex: org-columns-default-format

{{{noindent}}} or, even better, you can set up these values globally
by customizing the variables ~org-global-properties~ and
~org-columns-default-format~.  In particular if you want to use this
setup also in the agenda, a global setup may be advised.

The way to assign estimates to individual items is then to switch to
column mode, and to use {{{kbdkey(S-,right)}}} and
{{{kbdkey(S-,left)}}} to change the value.  The values you enter will
immediately be summed up in the hierarchy.  In the column next to it,
any clocked time will be displayed.

#+vindex: org-agenda-columns-add-appointments-to-effort-sum

If you switch to column view in the daily/weekly agenda, the effort column
will summarize the estimated work effort for each day, and you can use this to find space in your schedule.  To get
an overview of the entire part of the day that is committed, you can set the
option ~org-agenda-columns-add-appointments-to-effort-sum~.[fn:179] The
appointments on a day that take place over a specified time interval will
then also be added to the load estimate of the day.

Effort estimates can be used in secondary agenda filtering that is
triggered with the {{{kbd(/)}}} key in the agenda (see [[Agenda
commands]]).  If you have these estimates defined consistently, two or
three key presses will narrow down the list to stuff that fits into an
available time slot.

** Relative timer
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Notes with a running timer
   :TITLE:    Taking notes with a relative timer
   :END:
#+cindex: relative timer

When taking notes during, for example, a meeting or a video viewing, it can
be useful to have access to times relative to a starting time.  Org provides
such a relative timer and make it easy to create timed notes.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-x .)}}}, ~org-timer~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x .

  Insert a relative time into the buffer.  The first time you use this, the
  timer will be started.  When called with a prefix argument, the timer is
  restarted.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-x -)}}}, ~org-timer-item~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x -

  Insert a description list item with the current relative time.  With a prefix
  argument, first reset the timer to 0.

- {{{kbdkey(M-,RET)}}}, ~org-insert-heading~ ::
  #+kindex: M-@key{RET}

  Once the timer list is started, you can also use {{{kbdkey(M-,RET)}}}
  to insert new timer items.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-x \,)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x ,
  #+kindex: C-c C-x ,

  Pause the timer, or continue it if it is already paused
  ({{{command(org-timer-pause-or-continue)}}}).

- {{{kbd(C-u C-c C-x \,)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-u C-c C-x ,
  #+kindex: C-u C-c C-x ,

  Stop the timer.  After this, you can only start a new timer, not
  continue the old one.  This command also removes the timer from the
  mode line.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-x 0)}}}, ~org-timer-start~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x 0

  Reset the timer without inserting anything into the buffer.  By
  default, the timer is reset to 0.  When called with a {{{kbd(C-u)}}}
  prefix, reset the timer to specific starting offset.  The user is
  prompted for the offset, with a default taken from a timer string at
  point, if any, So this can be used to restart taking notes after a
  break in the process.  When called with a double prefix argument
  {{{kbd(C-u C-u)}}}, change all timer strings in the active region by a
  certain amount.  This can be used to fix timer strings if the timer was
  not started at exactly the right moment.

** Countdown timer
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Starting a countdown timer for a task
   :END:
#+cindex: Countdown timer
#+kindex: C-c C-x ;
#+kindex: ;

Calling ~org-timer-set-timer~ from an Org mode buffer runs a countdown
timer.  Use {{{kbd(;)}}} from agenda buffers, {{{key(C-c C-x ;)}}}
everywhere else.

~org-timer-set-timer~ prompts the user for a duration and displays a
countdown timer in the modeline.  ~org-timer-default-timer~ sets the
default countdown value.  Giving a prefix numeric argument overrides this
default value.

* Capture - Refile - Archive
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: The ins and outs for projects
  :END:
#+cindex: capture

An important part of any organization system is the ability to quickly
capture new ideas and tasks, and to associate reference material with
them.  Org does this using a process called /capture/.  It also can
store files related to a task (/attachments/) in a special directory.
Once in the system, tasks and projects need to be moved around.  Moving
completed project trees to an archive file keeps the system compact
and fast.

** Capture
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Capturing new stuff
   :END:
#+cindex: capture

Org's method for capturing new items is heavily inspired by John
Wiegley excellent remember package.  Up to version 6.36 Org used a
special setup for {{{file(remember.el)}}}.  The file {{{file(org-remember.el)}}}
is still part of Org mode for backward compatibility with existing
setups.  You can find the documentation for org-remember at
[[https://orgmode.org/org-remember.pdf]].

The new capturing setup described here is preferred and should be used by new
users.  To convert your ~org-remember-templates~, run the following command:
{{{kbdspckey(M-x org-capture-import-remember-templates,RET)}}}

{{{noindent}}} and then customize the new variable with 
{{{kbd(M-x customize-variable org-capture-templates)}}}, check the result, and
save the customization.  You can then use both remember and capture
until you are familiar with the new mechanism.

Capture lets you quickly store notes with little interruption of your work
flow.  The basic process of capturing is very similar to remember, but Org
does enhance it with templates and more.

*** Setting up capture
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Where notes will be stored
    :END:

The following customization sets a default target file for notes, and defines
a global key for capturing new material.[fn:81]

#+vindex: org-default-notes-file
#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-default-notes-file (concat org-directory "/notes.org"))
(define-key global-map "\C-cc" 'org-capture)
#+end_src

*** Using capture
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Commands to invoke and terminate capture
    :END:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c c)}}}, ~org-capture~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c c
  #+cindex: date tree

  Call the command ~org-capture~.  Note that this keybinding is global
  and not active by default - you need to install it.  If you have
  templates defined (see [[Capture templates]], it will offer these
  templates for selection or use a new Org outline node as the default
  template.  It will insert the template into the target file and switch
  to an indirect buffer narrowed to this new node.  You may then insert
  the information you want.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}}, ~org-capture-finalize~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-c

  Once you have finished entering information into the capture buffer,
  {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} will return you to the window configuration before
  the capture process, so that you can resume your work without further
  distraction.  When called with a prefix argument, finalize and then
  jump to the captured item.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-w)}}}, ~org-capture-refile~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-w

  Finalize the capture process by refiling the note to a different place
  (see [[Refile and copy]]).  Please realize that this is a normal refiling
  command that will be executed---so the cursor position at the moment
  you run this command is important.  If you have inserted a tree with a
  parent and children, first move the cursor back to the parent.  Any
  prefix argument given to this command will be passed on to the
  ~org-refile~ command.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-k)}}}, ~org-capture-kill~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-k

  Abort the capture process and return to the previous state.


You can also call ~org-capture~ in a special way from the agenda,
using the {{{kbd(k c)}}} key combination.  With this access, timestamps
inserted by the selected capture template will default to the cursor
date in the agenda, rather than to the current date.

To find the locations of the last stored capture, use ~org-capture~ with
prefix commands:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-u C-c c)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-u C-c c

  Visit the target location of a capture template.  You get to select the
  template in the usual way.

- {{{kbd(C-u C-u C-c c)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-u C-u C-c c

  Visit the last stored capture item in its buffer.


#+vindex: org-capture-bookmark
#+cindex: org-capture-last-stored

You can also jump to the bookmark ~org-capture-last-stored~, which
will automatically be created unless you set ~org-capture-bookmark~ to
~nil~.

To insert the capture at point in an Org buffer, call ~org-capture~
with a ~C-0~ prefix argument.

*** Capture templates
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Define the outline of different note types
    :END:
#+cindex: templates, for Capture

You can use templates for different types of capture items, and for
different target locations.  The easiest way to create such templates
is through the customize interface.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c c C)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c c C

  Customize the variable ~org-capture-templates~.


Before we give the formal description of template definitions, let's
look at an example.  Say you would like to use one template to create
general TODO entries, and you want to put these entries under the
heading {{{samp(Tasks)}}} in your file {{{file(~/org/gtd.org)}}}.
Also, a date tree in the file {{{file(journal.org)}}} should capture
journal entries.  A possible configuration would look like:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-capture-templates
 '(("t" "Todo" entry (file+headline "~/org/gtd.org" "Tasks")
        "* TODO %?\n  %i\n  %a")
   ("j" "Journal" entry (file+datetree "~/org/journal.org")
        "* %?\nEntered on %U\n  %i\n  %a")))
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} If you then press {{{kbd(C-c c t)}}}, Org will prepare
the template for you like this:

#+begin_example
   ,* TODO
     [[file:link to where you initiated capture]]
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} During expansion of the template, ~%a~ has been
replaced by a link to the location from where you called the capture
command.  This can be extremely useful for deriving tasks from emails,
for example.  You fill in the task definition, press ~C-c C-c~ and Org
returns you to the same place where you started the capture process.

To define special keys to capture to a particular template without
going through the interactive template selection, you can create your
key binding like this:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(define-key global-map "\C-cx"
   (lambda () (interactive) (org-capture nil "x")))
#+end_src

**** Template elements
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: What is needed for a complete template entry
     :END:

Now lets look at the elements of a template definition.  Each entry in
~org-capture-templates~ is a list with the following items:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~keys~ ::

  The keys that will select the template, as a string, characters
  only, for example "a" for a template to be selected with a
  single key, or "BTW" for selection with two keys.  When using
  several keys, keys using the same prefix key must be sequential
  in the list and preceded by a 2-element entry explaining the
  prefix key, for example:

  #+header: :eval no
  #+header: :exports code
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ("b" "Templates for marking stuff to buy")
  #+end_src

  {{{noindent}}} If you do not define a template for the {{{kbd(C)}}}
  key, this key will be used to open the customize buffer for this
  complex variable.

- ~description~ ::

  A short string describing the template, which will be shown during
  selection.

- ~type~ ::

  The type of entry, a symbol.  Valid values are:

  - ~entry~ ::

    An Org mode node, with a headline.  Will be filed as the child of the
    target entry or as a top-level entry.  The target file should be an Org
    mode file.

  - ~item~ ::

    A plain list item, placed in the first plain list at the target
    location.  Again the target file should be an Org file.

  - ~checkitem~ ::

    A checkbox item.  This only differs from the plain list item by the
    default template.

  - ~table-line~ ::

    A new line in the first table at the target location.  Where exactly
    the line will be inserted depends on the properties ~:prepend~ and
    ~:table-line-pos~ (see below).

  - plain ::

    Text to be inserted as it is.

- target ::
  #+vindex: org-default-notes-file

  Specification of where the captured item should be placed.  In Org mode
  files, targets usually define a node.  Entries will become children of this
  node.  Other types will be added to the table or list in the body of this
  node.  Most target specifications contain a file name.  If that file name is
  the empty string, it defaults to ~org-default-notes-file~.  A file can
  also be given as a variable, function, or Emacs Lisp form.

  Valid values are:

  - ~(file "path/to/file")~ ::

    Text will be placed at the beginning or end of that file.

  - ~(id "id of existing org entry")~ ::

    Filing as child of this entry, or in the body of the entry.

  - ~(file+headline "path/to/file" "node headline")~ ::

    Fast configuration if the target heading is unique in the file.

  - ~(file+olp "path/to/file" "Level 1 heading" "Level 2" ...)~ ::

    For non-unique headings, the full path is safer.

  - ~(file+regexp  "path/to/file" "regexp to find location")~ ::

    Use a regular expression to position the cursor.

  - ~(file+datetree "path/to/file")~ ::

    Will create a heading in a date tree for today's date.

  - ~(file+datetree+prompt "path/to/file")~ ::

    Will create a heading in a date tree, but will prompt for the date.

  - ~(file+function "path/to/file" function-finding-location)~ ::

    A function to find the right location in the file.

  - ~(clock)~ ::

    File to the entry that is currently being clocked.

  - ~(function function-finding-location)~ ::

    Most general way, write your own function to find both
    file and location.

- ~template~ ::

  The template for creating the capture item.  If you leave this empty,
  an appropriate default template will be used.  Otherwise this is a
  string with escape codes, which will be replaced depending on time and
  context of the capture call.  The string with escapes may be loaded
  from a template file, using the special syntax 
  ~(file "path/to/template")~.  See below for more details.

- ~properties~ ::

  The rest of the entry is a property list of additional options.
  Recognized properties are:

  - ~:prepend~ ::

    Normally new captured information will be appended at the target
    location (last child, last table line, last list item, ...).  Setting
    this property will change that.

  - ~:immediate-finish~ ::

    When set, do not offer to edit the information, just file it away
    immediately.  This makes sense if the template only needs information
    that can be added automatically.

  - ~:empty-lines~ ::

    Set this to the number of lines to insert before and after the new
    item.  The default is 0, and the only other common value is 1.

  - ~:clock-in~ ::

    Start the clock in this item.

  - ~:clock-keep~ ::

    Keep the clock running when filing the captured entry.

  - ~:clock-resume~ ::

    If starting the capture interrupted a clock, restart that clock when
    finished with the capture.  Note that ~:clock-keep~ has precedence over
    ~:clock-resume~.  When setting both to ~t~, the current clock will run
    and the previous one will not be resumed.

  - ~:unnarrowed~ ::

    Do not narrow the target buffer, simply show the full buffer.  Default
    is to narrow it so that you only see the new material.

  - ~:table-line-pos~ ::

    Specification of the location in the table where the new line should
    be inserted.  It should be a string like "II-3" meaning that the new
    line should become the third line before the second horizontal
    separator line.

  - ~:kill-buffer~ ::

    If the target file was not yet visited when capture was invoked, kill
    the buffer again after capture is completed.

**** Template expansion
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Filling in information about time and context
     :END:

In the template itself, special {{{kbd(%)}}}-escapes allow dynamic
insertion of content.[fn:82] The templates are expanded in the order given
here:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- %[{{{var(file)}}}] ::    

  Insert the contents of the file given by {{{var(file)}}}.

- %({{{var(sexp)}}}) ::    

  Evaluate Elisp {{{var(sexp)}}} and replace with the result.  The
  {{{var(sexp)}}} must return a string.

- %<...> ::     

  The result of format-time-string on the ...  format specification.

- %t ::         

  Timestamp, date only.

- %T ::         

  Timestamp, with date and time.

- %u, %U ::     

  Like ~%t~, ~%T~ above, but inactive timestamps.

- %i ::         

  Initial content, the region when capture is called while the region is
  active.  The entire text will be indented like ~%i~ itself.

- %a ::         

  Annotation, normally the link created with ~org-store-link~.

- %A ::         

  Like ~%a~, but prompt for the description part.

- %l ::         

  Like ~%a~, but only insert the literal link.

- %c ::         

  Current kill ring head.

- %x ::         

  Content of the X clipboard.

- %k ::         

  Title of the currently clocked task.

- %K ::         

  Link to the currently clocked task.

- %n ::         

  User name (taken from ~user-full-name~).

- %f ::         

  File visited by current buffer when org-capture was called.

- %F ::         

  Full path of the file or directory visited by current buffer.

- %:keyword ::   

  Specific information for certain link types, see below.

- %^g  ::       

  Prompt for tags, with completion on tags in target file.

- %^G  ::       

  Prompt for tags, with completion all tags in all agenda files.

- %^t  ::       

  Like ~%t~, but prompt for date.  Similarly ~%^T~, ~%^u~, ~%^U~.  You may
  define a prompt like ~%^{Birthday}t~.

- %^C  ::       

  Interactive selection of which kill or clip to use.

- %^L  ::       

  Like ~%^C~, but insert as link.

- %^{PROP}p ::  

  Prompt the user for a value for property {{{var(prop)}}}.

- %^{PROMPT} ::  

  Prompt the user for a string and replace this sequence with it.  You
  may specify a default value and a completion table with
  ~%^{prompt|default|completion2|completion3...}~.  The arrow keys access
  a prompt-specific history.

- %\n ::        

  Insert the text entered at the nth %^{PROMPT}, where ~n~ is
  a number, starting from 1.

- %? ::          

  After completing the template, position cursor here.


{{{noindent}}} For specific link types, the following keywords will be
defined:[fn:83]

#+vindex: org-from-is-user-regexp


#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis

- calendar :: ~%:date~                              

{{{noindent}}} To place the cursor after template expansion use:

#+begin_example
   %?          After completing the template, position cursor here.
#+end_example

**** Templates in contexts
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Only show a template in a specific context
     :END:

#+vindex: org-capture-templates-contexts

To control whether a capture template should be accessible from a
specific context, you can customize ~org-capture-templates-contexts~.
Let's say, for example, that you have a capture template "p" for
storing Gnus emails containing patches.  Then you would configure this
option like this:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-capture-templates-contexts
      '(("p" (in-mode . "message-mode"))))
#+end_src

You can also tell that the command key "p" should refer to another
template.  In that case, add this command key like this:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-capture-templates-contexts
      '(("p" "q" (in-mode . "message-mode"))))
#+end_src

See the docstring of the variable ~org-capture-templates-contexts~ for
more information.

** Attachments
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Add files to tasks
   :END:
#+cindex: attachments
#+vindex: org-attach-directory

It is often useful to associate reference material with an outline
node/task.  Small chunks of plain text can simply be stored in the
subtree of a project.  Hyperlinks (see [[Hyperlinks]]) can establish
associations with files that live elsewhere on your computer or in the
cloud, like emails or source code files belonging to a project.
Another method is /attachments/, which are files located in a
directory belonging to an outline node.  Org uses directories named by
the unique ID of each entry.  These directories are located in the
{{{file(data)}}} directory which lives in the same directory where
your Org file lives.[fn:85] If you initialize this directory with
~git init~, Org will automatically commit changes when it sees them.
The attachment system has been contributed to Org by John Wiegley.

In cases where it seems better to do so, you can also attach a
directory of your choice to an entry.  You can also make children
inherit the attachment directory from a parent, so that an entire
subtree uses the same attached directory.

{{{noindent}}} The following commands deal with attachments:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-a)}}}, ~org-attach~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-a

  The dispatcher for commands related to the attachment system.  After
  these keys, a list of commands is displayed and you must press an
  additional key to select a command:

  - {{{kbd(a)}}}, ~org-attach-attach~ ::
    #+kindex: C-c C-a a
    #+vindex: org-attach-method

    Select a file and move it into the task's attachment directory.  The
    file will be copied, moved, or linked, depending on
    ~org-attach-method~.  Note that hard links are not supported on all
    systems.

  - {{{kbd(c)}}}/{{{kbd(m)}}}/{{{kbd(l)}}} ::
    #+kindex: C-c C-a c
    #+kindex: C-c C-a m
    #+kindex: C-c C-a l

    Attach a file using the copy/move/link method.  Note that hard links
    are not supported on all systems.

  - {{{kbd(n)}}}, ~org-attach-new~ ::
    #+kindex: C-c C-a n

    Create a new attachment as an Emacs buffer.

  - {{{kbd(z)}}}, ~org-attach-sync~ ::
    #+kindex: C-c C-a z

    Synchronize the current task with its attachment directory, in case
    you added attachments yourself.

  - {{{kbd(o)}}}, ~org-attach-open~ ::
    #+kindex: C-c C-a o
    #+vindex: org-file-apps

    Open current task's attachment.  If there is more than one, prompt for
    a file name first.  Opening will follow the rules set by
    ~org-file-apps~.  For more details, see the information on following
    hyperlinks (see [[Handling links]]).

  - {{{kbd(O)}}}, ~org-attach-open-in-emacs~ ::
    #+kindex: C-c C-a O

    Also open the attachment, but force opening the file in Emacs.

  - {{{kbd(f)}}}, ~org-attach-reveal~ ::
    #+kindex: C-c C-a f

    Open the current task's attachment directory.

  - {{{kbd(F)}}}, ~org-attach-reveal-in-emacs~ ::
    #+kindex: C-c C-a F

    Also open the directory, but force using @command{dired} in Emacs.

  - {{{kbd(d)}}}, ~org-attach-delete-one~ ::
    #+kindex: C-c C-a d

    Select and delete a single attachment.

  - {{{kbd(D)}}}, ~org-attach-delete-all~ ::
    #+kindex: C-c C-a D

    Delete all of a task's attachments.  A safer way is to open the
    directory in {{{command(dired)}}} and delete from there.

  - {{{kbd(s)}}}, ~org-attach-set-directory~ ::
    #+kindex: C-c C-a s
    #+cindex: property, ATTACH_DIR

    Set a specific directory as the entry's attachment directory.  This
    works by putting the directory path into the ~ATTACH_DIR~ property.

  - {{{kbd(i)}}}, ~org-attach-set-inherit~ ::
    #+kindex: C-c C-a i
    #+cindex: property, ATTACH_DIR_INHERIT

    Set the ~ATTACH_DIR_INHERIT~ property, so that children will use the
    same directory for attachments as the parent does.

** RSS feeds

Org can add and change entries based on information found in RSS feeds and
Atom feeds.  You could use this to make a task out of each new podcast in a
podcast feed.  Or you could use a phone-based note-creating service on the
web to import tasks into Org.  To access feeds, configure the variable
~org-feed-alist~.  The docstring of this variable has detailed
information.  Here is an example:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-feed-alist
     '(("Slashdot"
         "http://rss.slashdot.org/Slashdot/slashdot"
         "~/txt/org/feeds.org" "Slashdot Entries")))
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} will configure that new items from the feed provided by
~rss.slashdot.org~ will result in new entries in the file
{{{file(~/org/feeds.org)}}} under the heading ~Slashdot Entries~,
whenever the following command is used:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-x g)}}}, ~org-feed-update-all~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x g

  Collect items from the feeds configured in ~org-feed-alist~ and act
  upon them.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-x G)}}}, ~org-feed-goto-inbox~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x G

  Prompt for a feed name and go to the inbox configured for this feed.


Under the same headline, Org will create a drawer
{{{samp(FEEDSTATUS)}}} in which it will store information about the
status of items in the feed, to avoid adding the same item several
times.  You should add {{{samp(FEEDSTATUS)}}} to the list of drawers in
that file:

#+begin_example
   ,#+DRAWERS: LOGBOOK PROPERTIES FEEDSTATUS
#+end_example

For more information, including how to read atom feeds, see
{{{file(org-feed.el)}}} and the docstring of ~org-feed-alist~.

** Protocols
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: External (e.g., browser) access to Emacs and Org
   :TITLE:    Protocols for external access
   :END:

#+cindex: protocols, for external access
#+cindex: emacsserver

You can set up Org for handling protocol calls from outside
applications that are passed to Emacs through the
{{{file(emacsserver)}}}.  For example, you can configure bookmarks in
your web browser to send a link to the current page to Org and create
a note from it using capture (see [[Capture]]).  Or you could create a
bookmark that will tell Emacs to open the local source file of a
remote website you are looking at with the browser.  See
[[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.php]] for detailed
documentation and setup instructions.

** Refile and copy
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Moving/copying a tree from one place to another
   :END:
#+cindex: refiling notes
#+cindex: copying notes

When reviewing the captured data, you may want to refile or to copy some of
the entries into a different list, for example into a project.  Cutting,
finding the right location, and then pasting the note is cumbersome.  To
simplify this process, you can use the following special command:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c M-w)}}}, ~org-copy~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c M-w
  #+findex: org-copy

  Copying works like refiling, except that the original note is not deleted.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-w)}}}, ~org-refile~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-w
  #+findex: org-refile
  #+vindex: org-reverse-note-order
  #+vindex: org-refile-targets
  #+vindex: org-refile-use-outline-path
  #+vindex: org-outline-path-complete-in-steps
  #+vindex: org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes
  #+vindex: org-log-refile
  #+vindex: org-refile-use-cache

  Refile the entry or region at point.  This command offers possible
  locations for refiling the entry and lets you select one with
  completion.  The item (or all items in the region) is filed below the
  target heading as a subitem.  Depending on ~org-reverse-note-order~, it
  will be either the first or last subitem.

  By default, all level 1 headlines in the current buffer are considered
  to be targets, but you can have more complex definitions across a
  number of files.  See the variable ~org-refile-targets~ for details.  If
  you would like to select a location via a file-path-like completion
  along the outline path, see the variables
  ~org-refile-use-outline-path~ and
  ~org-outline-path-complete-in-steps~.  If you would like to be able to
  create new nodes as new parents for refiling on the fly, check the
  variable ~org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes~.  When the variable
  ~org-log-refile~ is set, a timestamp or a note will be recorded when
  an entry has been refiled.[fn:86]

- {{{kbd(C-u C-c C-w)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-u C-c C-w

  Use the refile interface to jump to a heading.

- {{{kbd(C-u C-u C-c C-w)}}}, ~org-refile-goto-last-stored~ ::
  #+kindex: C-u C-u C-c C-w

  Jump to the location where ~org-refile~ last moved a tree to.

- {{{kbd(C-2 C-c C-w)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-2 C-c C-w

  Refile as the child of the item currently being clocked.

- {{{kbd(C-0 C-c C-w)}}} or {{{kbd(C-u C-u C-u C-c C-w)}}}, ~org-refile-cache-clear~ ::
  #+kindex: C-u C-u C-u C-c C-w
  #+kindex: C-0 C-c C-w

  Clear the target cache.  Caching of refile targets can be turned on by
  setting ~org-refile-use-cache~.  To make the command see new possible
  targets, you have to clear the cache with this command.

** Archiving
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: What to do with finished products
   :END:
#+cindex: archiving

When a project represented by a (sub)tree is finished, you may want to
move the tree out of the way and to stop it from contributing to the
agenda.  Archiving is important to keep your working files compact and
global searches like the construction of agenda views fast.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-a)}}}, ~org-archive-subtree-default~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x C-a
  #+vindex: org-archive-default-command

  Archive the current entry using the command specified in the variable
  ~org-archive-default-command~.

*** Moving subtrees
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Moving a tree to an archive file
    :TITLE:    Moving a tree to an archive file
    :END:
#+cindex: external archiving

The most common archiving action is to move a project tree to another file,
the archive file.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-s)}}} or short {{{kbd(C-c $)}}}, ~org-archive-subtree~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x C-s
  #+kindex: C-c $
  #+vindex: org-archive-location

  Archive the subtree starting at the cursor position to the location
  given by ~org-archive-location~.

- {{{Kbd(C-u C-c C-x C-s)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-u C-c C-x C-s

  Check if any direct children of the current headline could be moved to
  the archive.  To do this, each subtree is checked for open TODO
  entries.  If none are found, the command offers to move it to the
  archive location.  If the cursor is /not/ on a headline when this
  command is invoked, the level 1 trees will be checked.


#+cindex: archive locations

The default archive location is a file in the same directory as the
current file, with the name derived by appending {{{file(_archive)}}}
to the current file name.  You can also choose what heading to file
archived items under, with the possibility to add them to a datetree
in a file.  For information and examples on how to specify the file and
the heading, see the documentation string of the variable
~org-archive-location~.

There is also an in-buffer option for setting this variable, for
example:[fn:87]

#+cindex: #+ARCHIVE
#+begin_example
   ,#+ARCHIVE: %s_done::
#+end_example

#+cindex: property, ARCHIVE

{{{noindent}}} If you would like to have a special ARCHIVE location
for a single entry or a (sub)tree, give the entry an ~:ARCHIVE:~
property with the location as the value (see [[Properties and columns]]).

#+vindex: org-archive-save-context-info

When a subtree is moved, it receives a number of special properties
that record context information like the file from where the entry
came, its outline path the archiving time etc.  Configure the variable
~org-archive-save-context-info~ to adjust the amount of information
added.

*** Internal archiving
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Switch off a tree but keep it in the file
    :END:

If you want to just switch off (for agenda views) certain subtrees
without moving them to a different file, you can use the ~ARCHIVE
tag~.

A headline that is marked with the ARCHIVE tag (see [[Tags]]) stays at
its location in the outline tree, but behaves in the following way:

- It does not open when you attempt to do so with a visibility cycling
  command (see [[Visibility cycling]]).  You can force cycling archived
  subtrees with {{{kbdkey(C-,TAB)}}}, or by setting the option
  ~org-cycle-open-archived-trees~.  Also normal outline commands like
  ~show-all~ will open archived subtrees.

  #+vindex: org-cycle-open-archived-trees

- During sparse tree construction (see [[Sparse trees]]), matches in
  archived subtrees are not exposed, unless you configure the option
  ~org-sparse-tree-open-archived-trees~.

  #+vindex: org-sparse-tree-open-archived-trees

- During agenda view construction (see [[Agenda views]]), the content of
  archived trees is ignored unless you configure the option
  ~org-agenda-skip-archived-trees~, in which case these trees will
  always be included.  In the agenda you can press {{{kbd(v a)}}} to
  get archives temporarily included.

  #+vindex: org-agenda-skip-archived-trees

- Archived trees are not exported (see [[Exporting]]), only the headline
  is.  Configure the details using the variable
  ~org-export-with-archived-trees~.

  #+vindex: org-export-with-archived-trees

- Archived trees are excluded from column view unless the variable
  ~org-columns-skip-archived-trees~ is configured to ~nil~.

  #+vindex: org-columns-skip-archived-trees


The following commands help manage the ARCHIVE tag:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-x a)}}}, ~org-toggle-archive-tag~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x a

  Toggle the ARCHIVE tag for the current headline.  When the tag is set,
  the headline changes to a shadowed face, and the subtree below it is
  hidden.

- {{{kbd(C-u C-c C-x a)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-u C-c C-x a

  Check if any direct children of the current headline should be
  archived.  To do this, each subtree is checked for open TODO entries.
  If none are found, the command offers to set the ARCHIVE tag for the
  child.  If the cursor is /not/ on a headline when this command is
  invoked, the level 1 trees will be checked.

- {{{kbdkey(C-,TAB)}}}, ~org-force-cycle-archived~ ::

  Cycle a tree even if it is tagged with ARCHIVE.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-x A)}}}, ~org-archive-to-archive-sibling~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x A

  Move the current entry to the /Archive Sibling/.  This is a sibling of
  the entry with the heading {{{samp(Archive)}}} and the tag
  {{{samp(ARCHIVE)}}}.  The entry becomes a child of that sibling and in
  this way retains a lot of its original context, including inherited
  tags and approximate position in the outline.

* FIXME Agenda views
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: Collecting information into views
  :ALT_TITLE: Agenda Views
  :END:

Due to the way Org works, TODO items, time-stamped items, and tagged
headlines can be scattered throughout a file or even a number of
files.  To get an overview of open action items, or of events that are
important for a particular date, this information must be collected,
sorted and displayed in an organized way.

Org can select items based on various criteria and display them
in a separate buffer.  Seven different view types are provided:

- an /agenda/ that is like a calendar and shows information for
  specific dates,

- a /TODO list/ that covers all unfinished action items,

- a /match view/, showings headlines based on the tags, properties,
  and TODO state associated with them,

- a /timeline view/ that shows all events in a single Org file, in
  time-sorted view,

- a /text search view/ that shows all entries from multiple files that
  contain specified keywords,

- a /stuck projects view/ showing projects that currently don't move
  along, and

- /custom views/ that are special searches and combinations of
  different views.


{{{noindent}}} The extracted information is displayed in a special
/agenda buffer/.  This buffer is read-only, but provides commands to
visit the corresponding locations in the original Org files, and even
to edit these files remotely.

#+vindex: org-agenda-window-setup
#+vindex: org-agenda-restore-windows-after-quit

Two variables control how the agenda buffer is displayed and whether
the window configuration is restored when the agenda exits:
~org-agenda-window-setup~ and ~org-agenda-restore-windows-after-quit~.

** Agenda files
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Files being searched for agenda information
   :END:
#+cindex: agenda files
#+cindex: files for agenda
#+vindex: org-agenda-files

The information to be shown is normally collected from all /agenda
files/, the files listed in the variable ~org-agenda-files~.[fn:180] If
a directory is part of this list, all files with the extension
{{{file(.org)}}} in this directory will be part of the list.

Thus, even if you only work with a single Org file, that file should
be put into the list.[fn:88]  You can customize ~org-agenda-files~, but
the easiest way to maintain it is through the following commands

#+cindex: files, adding to agenda list
#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c [)}}}, ~org-agenda-file-to-front~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c [

  Add current file to the list of agenda files.  The file is added to the
  front of the list.  If it was already in the list, it is moved to the
  front.  With a prefix argument, file is added/moved to the end.

- {{{kbd(C-c ])}}}, ~org-remove-file~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c ]

  Remove current file from the list of agenda files.

- {{{kbd(C-')}}} {{{kbd(C-)}}}, ~org-cycle-agenda-files~ ::
  #+kindex: C-'
  #+kindex: C-,
  #+cindex: cycling, of agenda files

  Cycle through agenda file list, visiting one file after the other.

- {{{kbd(M-x org-switchb)}}} ::
  #+findex: org-switchb

  Command to use an ~iswitchb~-like interface to switch to and between
  Org buffers.


{{{noindent}}} The Org menu contains the current list of files and can
be used to visit any of them.

If you would like to focus the agenda temporarily on a file not in
this list, or on just one file in the list, or even on only a subtree
in a file, then this can be done in different ways.  For a single
agenda command, you may press {{{kbd(<)}}} once or several times in
the dispatcher (see [[Agenda dispatcher]]).  To restrict the agenda scope
for an extended period, use the following commands:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-x <)}}}, ~org-agenda-set-restriction-lock~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x <

  Permanently restrict the agenda to the current subtree.  When with a
  prefix argument, or with the cursor before the first headline in a
  file, the agenda scope is set to the entire file.  This restriction
  remains in effect until removed with {{{kbd(C-c C-x >)}}}, or by
  typing either {{{kbd(<)}}} or {{{kbd(>)}}} in the agenda dispatcher.
  If there is a window displaying an agenda view, the new restriction
  takes effect immediately.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-x >)}}}, ~org-agenda-remove-restriction-lock~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x >

  Remove the permanent restriction created by {{{kbd(C-c C-x <)}}}.


{{{noindent}}} When working with {{{file(speedbar.el)}}}, you can use
the following commands in the Speedbar frame:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(<)}}} in the speedbar frame ~org-speedbar-set-agenda-restriction~ ::
  #+kindex: <

  Permanently restrict the agenda to the item---either an Org file or a
  subtree in such a file---at the cursor in the Speedbar frame.  If there
  is a window displaying an agenda view, the new restriction takes
  effect immediately.

- {{{kbd(>)}}} in the speedbar frame ~org-agenda-remove-restriction-lock~ ::
  #+kindex: >

  Lift the restriction.

** Agenda dispatcher
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Keyboard access to agenda views
   :TITLE:    The agenda dispatcher
   :END:
#+cindex: agenda dispatcher
#+cindex: dispatching agenda commands

The views are created through a dispatcher, which should be bound to a
global key---for example {{{kbd(C-c a)}}} (see [[Activation]]).  In the
following we will assume that {{{kbd(C-c a)}}} is indeed how the
dispatcher is accessed and list keyboard access to commands
accordingly.  After pressing {{{kbd(C-c a)}}}, an additional letter is
required to execute a command.  The dispatcher offers the following
default commands:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(a)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c a a

  Create the calendar-like agenda (see [[Weekly/daily agenda]]).

- {{{kbd(t)}}} or {{{kbd(T)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c a t
  #+kindex: C-c a T

  Create a list of all TODO items (see [[Global TODO list]]).

- {{{kbd(m)}}} or {{{kbd(M)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c a m
  #+kindex: C-c a M

  Create a list of headlines matching a TAGS expression (see [[Matching tags and properties]]).

- {{{kbd(L)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c a L

  Create the timeline view for the current buffer 
  (see [[Timeline for a single file]]).

- {{{kbd(s)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c a s

  Create a list of entries selected by a boolean expression of keywords
  and/or regular expressions that must or must not occur in the entry.

- {{{kbd(/)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c a /
  #+vindex: org-agenda-text-search-extra-files

  Search for a regular expression in all agenda files and additionally
  in the files listed in ~org-agenda-text-search-extra-files~.  This uses
  the Emacs command ~multi-occur~.  A prefix argument can be used to
  specify the number of context lines for each match, default is
  1.

- {{{kbd(#)}}} or {{{kbd(!)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c a #
  #+kindex: C-c a !
  Create a list of stuck projects (see [[Stuck projects]]).

- {{{kbd(<)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c a <

  Restrict an agenda command to the current buffer.[fn:89] After
  pressing {{{kbd(<)}}}, you still need to press the character selecting
  the command.

- {{{kbd(< <)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c a < <

  If there is an active region, restrict the following agenda command to
  the region.  Otherwise, restrict it to the current subtree.[fn:90]
  After pressing {{{kbd(< <)}}}, you still need to press the character
  selecting the command.

- {{{kbd(*)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c a *
  #+vindex: org-agenda-sticky

  Toggle sticky agenda views.  By default, Org maintains only a single
  agenda buffer and rebuilds it each time you change the view, to make
  sure everything is always up to date.  If you switch between views
  often and the build time bothers you, you can turn on sticky agenda
  buffers (make this the default by customizing the variable
  ~org-agenda-sticky~).  With sticky agendas, the dispatcher only
  switches to the selected view, you need to update it by hand with
  {{{kbd(r)}}} or {{{kbd(g)}}}.  You can toggle sticky agenda view any
  time with ~org-toggle-sticky-agenda~.


You can also define custom commands that will be accessible through
the dispatcher, just like the default commands.  This includes the
possibility to create extended agenda buffers that contain several
blocks together, for example the weekly agenda, the global TODO list
and a number of special tags matches.  See [[Custom agenda views]].

** Built-in agenda views
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: What is available out of the box?
   :TITLE: The built-in agenda views
   :END:
In this section we describe the built-in views.

*** FIXED Weekly/daily agenda
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: The calendar page with current tasks
    :END:
#+cindex: agenda
#+cindex: weekly agenda
#+cindex: daily agenda

The purpose of the weekly/daily /agenda/ is to act like a page of a
paper agenda, showing all the tasks for the current week or day.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c a a)}}}, ~org-agenda-list~ ::
  #+cindex: org-agenda, command

  Compile an agenda for the current week from a list of Org files.  The
  agenda shows the entries for each day.  With a numeric prefix (like
  {{{kbd(C-u 2 1 C-c a a)}}}) you may set the number of days to be
  displayed.[fn:91]


#+vindex: org-agenda-span
#+vindex: org-agenda-ndays
The default number of days displayed in the agenda is set by the variable
~org-agenda-span~ (or the obsolete ~org-agenda-ndays~).  This
variable can be set to any number of days you want to see by default in the
agenda, or to a span name, such a ~day~, ~week~, ~month~ or
~year~.

Remote editing from the agenda buffer means, for example, that you can
change the dates of deadlines and appointments from the agenda buffer.
The commands available in the Agenda buffer are listed in [[Agenda
commands]].

**** FIXED Calendar/Diary integration
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Integrate the Emacs diary with Org
     :END:
#+cindex: calendar integration
#+cindex: diary integration
#+cindex: Reingold, Edward M.

Emacs contains the calendar and diary by Edward M.  Reingold.  The
calendar displays a three-month calendar with holidays from different
countries and cultures.  The diary allows you to keep track of
anniversaries, lunar phases, sunrise/set, recurrent appointments
(weekly, monthly) and more.  In this way, it is quite complementary to
Org.  It can be very useful to combine output from Org with
the diary.

In order to include entries from the Emacs diary into Org mode's
agenda, you only need to customize the variable

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-agenda-include-diary t)
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} After that, everything will happen automatically.  All diary
entries including holidays, anniversaries, etc., will be included in the
agenda buffer created by Org mode.  {{{key(SPC)}}}, {{{key(TAB)}}}, and
{{{key(RET)}}} can be used from the agenda buffer to jump to the diary
file in order to edit existing diary entries.  The {{{kbd(i)}}} command to
insert new entries for the current date works in the agenda buffer, as
well as the commands {{{kbd(S)}}}, {{{kbd(M)}}}, and {{{kbd(C)}}} to display
Sunrise/Sunset times, show lunar phases and to convert to other
calendars, respectively.  {{{kbd(c)}}} can be used to switch back and forth
between calendar and agenda.

If you are using the diary only for sexp entries and holidays, it is
faster to not use the above setting, but instead to copy or even move
the entries into an Org file.  Org mode evaluates diary-style sexp
entries, and does it faster because there is no overhead for first
creating the diary display.  Note that the sexp entries must start at
the left margin, no whitespace is allowed before them.  For example,
the following segment of an Org file will be processed and entries
will be made in the agenda:[fn:181]

#+begin_example
   ,* Birthdays and similar stuff
   ,#+CATEGORY: Holiday
   %%(org-calendar-holiday)   ; special function for holiday names
   ,#+CATEGORY: Ann
   %%(org-anniversary 1956  5 14) Arthur Dent is %d years old
   %%(org-anniversary 1869 10  2) Mahatma Gandhi would be %d years old
#+end_example

**** FIXED Anniversaries from BBDB
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Integrate Big Brother Database and Org
     :END:

#+cindex: BBDB, anniversaries
#+cindex: anniversaries, from BBDB

If you are using the Big Brothers Database to store your contacts, you will
very likely prefer to store anniversaries in BBDB rather than in a
separate Org or diary file.  Org supports this and will show BBDB
anniversaries as part of the agenda.  All you need to do is to add the
following to one of your agenda files:

#+begin_example
   ,* Anniversaries
   ,  :PROPERTIES:
   ,  :CATEGORY: Anniv
   ,  :END:
   ,%%(org-bbdb-anniversaries)
#+end_example

You can then go ahead and define anniversaries for a BBDB record.
Basically, you need to press {{{kbdspckey(C-o anniversary,RET)}}} with
the cursor in a BBDB record and then add the date in the format
~YYYY-MM-DD~ or ~MM-DD~, followed by a space and the class of the
anniversary ({{{samp(birthday)}}} or {{{samp(wedding)}}}, or a format
string).  If you omit the class, it will default to
{{{samp(birthday)}}}.  Here are a few examples, the header for the file
{{{file(org-bbdb.el)}}} contains more detailed information.

#+begin_example
   1973-06-22
   06-22
   1955-08-02 wedding
   2008-04-14 %s released version 6.01 of org mode, %d years ago
#+end_example

After a change to BBDB, or for the first agenda display during an
Emacs session, the agenda display will suffer a short delay as Org
updates its hash with anniversaries.  However, from then on things will
be very fast---much faster in fact than a long list of
{{{samp(%%(diary-anniversary))}}} entries in an Org or Diary file.

**** FIXED Appointment reminders
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Integrate the Emacs appointment facility and Org
     :END:
#+cindex: @file{appt.el}
#+cindex: appointment reminders
#+cindex: appointment
#+cindex: reminders

Org can interact with Emacs appointments notification facility.  To add the
appointments of your agenda files, use the command ~org-agenda-to-appt~.
This command lets you filter through the list of your appointments and add
only those belonging to a specific category or matching a regular expression.
It also reads a ~APPT_WARNTIME~ property which will then override the
value of ~appt-message-warning-time~ for this appointment.  See the
docstring for details.

*** FIXED Global TODO list
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: All unfinished action items
    :END:
#+cindex: global TODO list
#+cindex: TODO list, global

The global TODO list contains all unfinished TODO items formatted and
collected into a single place.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c a t)}}}, ~org-todo-list~ ::

  Show the global TODO list.  This collects the TODO items from all
  agenda files (see [[Agenda views]]) into a single buffer.  By default, this
  lists items with a state the is not a DONE state.  The buffer is in
  ~agenda-mode~, so there are commands to examine and manipulate the
  TODO entries directly from that buffer (see [[Agenda commands]]).

- {{{kbd(C-c a T)}}}, ~org-todo-list~ ::

  #+cindex: TODO keyword matching
  #+vindex: org-todo-keywords

  Like the above, but allows selection of a specific TODO keyword.  You
  can also do this by specifying a prefix argument to {{{kbd(C-c a
  t)}}}.  You are prompted for a keyword, and you may also specify
  several keywords by separating them with {{{samp(|)}}} as the boolean
  OR operator.  With a numeric prefix, the Nth keyword in
  ~org-todo-keywords~ is selected.

  #+kindex: r

  The {{{kbd(r)}}} key in the agenda buffer regenerates it, and you can give
  a prefix argument to this command to change the selected TODO keyword,
  for example {{{kbd(3 r)}}}.  If you often need a search for a specific
  keyword, define a custom command for it (see [[Agenda dispatcher]]).

  Matching specific TODO keywords can also be done as part of a tags
  search (see [[Tag searches]]).


Remote editing of TODO items means that you can change the state of a
TODO entry with a single key press.  The commands available in the
TODO list are described in [[Agenda commands]].

#+cindex: sublevels, inclusion into TODO list

Normally the global TODO list simply shows all headlines with TODO
keywords.  This list can become very long.  There are two ways to keep
it more compact:


- Some people view a TODO item that has been /scheduled/ for execution
  or have a /deadline/ (see [[Timestamps]]) as no longer /open/.  Configure
  the variables ~org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled~,
  ~org-agenda-todo-ignore-deadlines~,
  ~org-agenda-todo-ignore-timestamp~ and/or
  ~org-agenda-todo-ignore-with-date~ to exclude such items from the
  global TODO list.

  #+vindex: org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled
  #+vindex: org-agenda-todo-ignore-deadlines
  #+vindex: org-agenda-todo-ignore-timestamp
  #+vindex: org-agenda-todo-ignore-with-date

- TODO items may have sublevels to break up the task into subtasks.  In
  such cases it may be enough to list only the highest level TODO
  headline and omit the sublevels from the global list.  Configure the
  variable ~org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels~ to get this behavior.

  #+vindex: org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels

*** Matching tags and properties

    :DESCRIPTION: Structured information with fine-tuned search
    :END:
#+cindex: matching, of tags
#+cindex: matching, of properties
#+cindex: tags view
#+cindex: match view

If headlines in the agenda files are marked with /tags/ (see [[Tags]]), or
have properties (see [[Properties and columns]]), you can select headlines
based on this metadata and collect them into an agenda buffer.  The
match syntax described here also applies when creating sparse trees
with {{{kbd(C-c / m)}}}.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c a m)}}}, ~org-tags-view~ ::

  Produce a list of all headlines that match a given set of tags.  The
  command prompts for a selection criterion, which is a boolean logic
  expression with tags, like {{{samp(+work+urgent-withboss)}}} or
  {{{samp(work|home)}}} (see [[Tags]]).  If you often need a specific search,
  define a custom command for it (see [[Agenda dispatcher]]).

- {{{kbd(C-c a M)}}}, ~org-tags-view~ ::

  #+vindex: org-tags-match-list-sublevels
  #+vindex: org-agenda-tags-todo-honor-ignore-options

  Like {{{kbd(C-c a m)}}}, but only select headlines that are also TODO
  items in a not-DONE state and force checking subitems (see the variable
  ~org-tags-match-list-sublevels~).  To exclude scheduled/deadline items,
  see the variable ~org-agenda-tags-todo-honor-ignore-options~.  Matching
  specific TODO keywords together with a tags match is also possible,
  see [[Tag searches]].


The commands available in the tags list are described in [[Agenda
commands]].


#+cindex: Boolean logic, for tag or property searches

A search string can use Boolean operators {{{samp(&)}}} for AND and
{{{samp(|)}}} for OR.  {{{samp(&)}}} binds more strongly than
{{{samp(|)}}}.  Parentheses are currently not implemented.  Each element
in the search is either a tag, a regular expression matching tags, or
an expression like ~PROPERTY OPERATOR VALUE~ with a comparison
operator, accessing a property value.  Each element may be preceded by
{{{samp(-)}}}, to select against it, and {{{samp(+)}}} is syntactic
sugar for positive selection.  The AND operator {{{samp(&)}}} is
optional when {{{samp(+)}}} or {{{samp(-)}}} is present.  Here are some
examples, using only tags.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @samp
- +work-boss ::

  Select headlines tagged {{{samp(:work:)}}}, but discard those also
  tagged {{{samp(:boss:)}}}.

- work|laptop ::

  Selects lines tagged {{{samp(:work:)}}} or {{{samp(:laptop:)}}}.

- work|laptop+night ::

  Like before, but require the {{{samp(:laptop:)}}} lines to be tagged
  also {{{samp(:night:)}}}.


#+cindex: regular expressions, with tags search

Instead of a tag, you may also specify a regular expression enclosed
in curly braces.  For example, {{{samp(work+{^boss.*})}}} matches
headlines that contain the tag {{{samp(:work:)}}} and any tag
/starting/ with {{{samp(boss)}}}.

#+cindex: TODO keyword matching, with tags search
#+cindex: level, require for tags/property match
#+cindex: category, require for tags/property match
#+vindex: org-odd-levels-only

You may also test for properties (see [[Properties and columns]]) at the
same time as matching tags.  The properties may be real properties, or
special properties that represent other metadata (see [[Special
properties]]).  For example, the "property" ~TODO~ represents the TODO
keyword of the entry.  Or, the "property" ~LEVEL~ represents the
level of an entry.  So a search {{{samp(+LEVEL=3+boss-TODO="DONE")}}}
lists all level three headlines that have the tag {{{samp(boss)}}} and
are /not/ marked with the TODO keyword DONE.  In buffers with
~org-odd-levels-only~ set, {{{samp(LEVEL)}}} does not count the number
of stars, but {{{samp(LEVEL=2)}}} will correspond to 3 stars etc.  The
ITEM special property cannot currently be used in tags/property
searches.[fn:92]

Here are more examples:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @samp
- work+TODO="WAITING" ::

  Select {{{samp(:work:)}}}-tagged TODO lines with the specific TODO
  keyword {{{samp(WAITING)}}}.

- work+TODO="WAITING"|home+TODO="WAITING" ::

  Waiting tasks both at work and at home.


When matching properties, a number of different operators can be used to test
the value of a property.  Here is a complex example:

#+begin_example
   +work-boss+PRIORITY="A"+Coffee="unlimited"+Effort<2         
            +With={Sarah|Denny}+SCHEDULED>="<2008-10-11>"
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} The type of comparison will depend on how the
comparison value is written:

- If the comparison value is a plain number, a numerical comparison is
  done, and the allowed operators are ~<~, ~=~, ~>~, ~<=~, ~>=~, and
  ~<>~.

- If the comparison value is enclosed in double-quotes, a string
  comparison is done, and the same operators are allowed.

- If the comparison value is enclosed in double-quotes /and/ angular
  brackets (like {{{samp(DEADLINE<="<2008-12-24 18:30>")}}}), both
  values are assumed to be date/time specifications in the standard
  Org way, and the comparison will be done accordingly.  Special values
  that will be recognized are ~"<now>"~ for now (including time), and
  ~"<today>"~, and ~"<tomorrow>"~ for these days at 0:00 hours, i.e.@:
  without a time specification.  Also strings like ~"<+5d>"~ or
  ~"<-2m>"~ with units ~d~, ~w~, ~m~, and ~y~ for day, week, month,
  and year, respectively, can be used.

- If the comparison value is enclosed in curly braces, a regexp match
  is performed, with {{{samp(=)}}} meaning that the regexp matches the
  property value, and ~<>~ meaning that it does not match.


So the search string in the example finds entries tagged
{{{samp(:work:)}}} but not {{{samp(:boss:)}}}, which also have a
priority value {{{samp(A)}}}, a {{{samp(:Coffee:)}}} property with the
value {{{samp(unlimited)}}}, an {{{samp(Effort)}}} property that is
numerically smaller than 2, a {{{samp(:With:)}}} property that is
matched by the regular expression {{{samp(Sarah|Denny)}}}, and that
are scheduled on or after October 11, 2008.

Accessing TODO, LEVEL, and CATEGORY during a search is fast.  Accessing
any other properties will slow down the search.  However, once you have
paid the price by accessing one property, testing additional
properties is cheap again.

You can configure Org mode to use property inheritance during a
search, but beware that this can slow down searches considerably.  See
[[Property inheritance]], for details.

For backward compatibility, and also for typing speed, there is also a
different way to test TODO states in a search.  For this, terminate the
tags/property part of the search string (which may include several
terms connected with {{{samp(|)}}}) with a {{{samp(/)}}} and then
specify a Boolean expression just for TODO keywords.  The syntax is
then similar to that for tags, but should be applied with care: for
example, a positive selection on several TODO keywords cannot
meaningfully be combined with boolean AND.  However, /negative
selection/ combined with AND can be meaningful.  To make sure that only
lines are checked that actually have any TODO keyword (resulting in a
speed-up), use {{{kbd(C-c a M)}}}, or equivalently start the TODO part
after the slash with {{{samp(!)}}}.  Using {{{kbd(C-c a M)}}} or
{{{samp(/!)}}} will not match TODO keywords in a DONE state.  Examples:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @samp
- work/WAITING ::

  Same as {{{samp(work+TODO="WAITING")}}}

- work/!-WAITING-NEXT ::
  
  Select {{{samp(:work:)}}}-tagged TODO lines that are neither {{{samp(WAITING)}}}
  nor {{{samp(NEXT)}}}

- work/!+WAITING|+NEXT ::

  Select {{{samp(:work:)}}}-tagged TODO lines that are either
  {{{samp(WAITING)}}} or {{{samp(NEXT)}}}.

*** FIXED Timeline for a single file

    :ALT_TITLE: Timeline
    :END:

#+cindex: timeline, single file
#+cindex: time-sorted view

The timeline summarizes all time-stamped items from a single Org mode
file in a /time-sorted view/.  The main purpose of this command is
to give an overview over events in a project.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c a L)}}}, ~org-timeline~ ::

  Show a time-sorted view of the Org file, with all time-stamped items.
  When called with a {{{kbd(C-u)}}} prefix, all unfinished TODO entries
  (scheduled or not) are also listed under the current date.


{{{noindent}}} The commands available in the timeline buffer are
listed in [[Agenda commands]].

*** FIXED Search view
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Find entries by searching for text
    :END:
#+cindex: search view
#+cindex: text search
#+cindex: searching, for text

This agenda view is a general text search facility for Org mode entries.
It is particularly useful to find notes.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c a s)}}}, ~org-search-view~ ::

  This is a special search that lets you select entries by matching a
  substring or specific words using a boolean logic.


For example, the search string {{{samp(computer equipment)}}} will
find entries that contain {{{samp(computer equipment)}}} as a
substring.  If the two words are separated by more space or a line
break, the search will still match.  Search view can also search for
specific keywords in the entry, using Boolean logic.  The search string
{{{samp(+computer +wifi -ethernet -{8.11[bg]})}}} will search for
note entries that contain the keywords ~computer~ and ~wifi~, but not
the keyword ~ethernet~, and which are also not matched by the regular
expression ~8.11[bg]~, meaning to exclude both 8.11b and 8.11g.  The
first {{{samp(+)}}} is necessary to turn on word search, other
{{{samp(+)}}} characters are optional.  For more details, see the
docstring of the command ~org-search-view~.

#+vindex: org-agenda-text-search-extra-files

Note that in addition to the agenda files, this command will also
search the files listed in ~org-agenda-text-search-extra-files~.

*** FIXED Stuck projects
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Find projects you need to review
    :END:
#+pindex: GTD, Getting Things Done

If you are following a system like David Allen's GTD to organize your
work, one of the "duties" you have is a regular review to make sure
that all projects move along.  A /stuck/ project is a project that has
no defined next actions, so it will never show up in the TODO lists
Org mode produces.  During the review, you need to identify such
projects and define next actions for them.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c a #)}}}, ~org-agenda-list-stuck-projects~ ::

  List projects that are stuck.

- {{{kbd(C-c a !)}}} ::

  #+vindex: org-stuck-projects
  #+kindex: C-c a !

  Customize the variable ~org-stuck-projects~ to define what a stuck
  project is and how to find it.


You almost certainly will have to configure this view before it will
work for you.  The built-in default assumes that all your projects are
level-2 headlines, and that a project is not stuck if it has at least
one entry marked with a TODO keyword TODO or NEXT or NEXTACTION.

Let's assume that you, in your own way of using Org mode, identify
projects with a tag PROJECT, and that you use a TODO keyword MAYBE to
indicate a project that should not be considered yet.  Let's further
assume that the TODO keyword DONE marks finished projects, and that
NEXT and TODO indicate next actions.  The tag @SHOP indicates shopping
and is a next action even without the NEXT tag.  Finally, if the
project contains the special word IGNORE anywhere, it should not be
listed either.  In this case you would start by identifying eligible
projects with a tags/todo match (see [[Tag searches]]).
{{{samp(+PROJECT/-MAYBE-DONE)}}}, and then check for TODO, NEXT,
@SHOP, and IGNORE in the subtree to identify projects that are not
stuck.  The correct customization for this is:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-stuck-projects
      '("+PROJECT/-MAYBE-DONE" ("NEXT" "TODO") ("@@SHOP")
                               "\\<IGNORE\\>"))
#+end_src

Note that if a project is identified as non-stuck, the subtree of this entry
will still be searched for stuck projects.

** Presentation and sorting

   :DESCRIPTION: How agenda items are prepared for display
   :END:
#+cindex: presentation, of agenda items
#+vindex: org-agenda-prefix-format
#+vindex: org-agenda-tags-column

Before displaying items in an agenda view, Org mode visually prepares
the items and sorts them.  Each item occupies a single line.  The line
starts with a /prefix/ that contains the /category/ (see [[Categories]])
of the item and other important information.  You can customize in
which column tags will be displayed through ~org-agenda-tags-column~.
You can also customize the prefix using the option
~org-agenda-prefix-format~.  This prefix is followed by a cleaned-up
version of the outline headline associated with the item.

*** Categories
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Not all tasks are equal
    :END:

#+cindex: category
#+cindex: #+CATEGORY

The category is a broad label assigned to each agenda item.  By
default, the category is simply derived from the file name, but you
can also specify it with a special line in the buffer, like
this:[fn:93]

#+begin_example
   ,#+CATEGORY: Thesis
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}}
#+cindex: property, CATEGORY

If you would like to have a special CATEGORY for a single entry or a
(sub)tree, give the entry a ~:CATEGORY:~ property with the special
category you want to apply as the value.

{{{noindent}}} The display in the agenda buffer looks best if the
category is not longer than 10 characters.

{{{noindent}}} You can set up icons for category by customizing the
~org-agenda-category-icon-alist~ variable.
#+vindex: org-agenda-category-icon-alist

*** Time-of-day specifications
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How the agenda knows the time
    :END:
#+cindex: time-of-day specification

Org mode checks each agenda item for a time-of-day specification.  The
time can be part of the timestamp that triggered inclusion into the
agenda, for example as in ~<2005-05-10 Tue 19:00>~.  Time
ranges can be specified with two timestamps, like:

  ~<2005-05-10 Tue 20:30>--<2005-05-10 Tue 22:15>~.

In the headline of the entry itself, a time(range) may also appear as
plain text (like {{{samp(12:45)}}} or a {{{samp(8:30-1pm)}}}).  If the
agenda integrates the Emacs diary (see [[Weekly/daily agenda]]), time
specifications in diary entries are recognized as well.

For agenda display, Org mode extracts the time and displays it in a
standard 24 hour format as part of the prefix.  The example times in
the previous paragraphs would end up in the agenda like this:

#+begin_example
    8:30-13:00 Arthur Dent lies in front of the bulldozer
   12:45...... Ford Prefect arrives and takes Arthur to the pub
   19:00...... The Vogon reads his poem
   20:30-22:15 Marvin escorts the Hitchhikers to the bridge
#+end_example

#+cindex: time grid

If the agenda is in single-day mode, or for the display of today, the
timed entries are embedded in a time grid, like

#+begin_example
    8:00...... ------------------
    8:30-13:00 Arthur Dent lies in front of the bulldozer
   10:00...... ------------------
   12:00...... ------------------
   12:45...... Ford Prefect arrives and takes Arthur to the pub
   14:00...... ------------------
   16:00...... ------------------
   18:00...... ------------------
   19:00...... The Vogon reads his poem

   20:30-22:15 Marvin escorts the Hitchhikers to the bridge
#+end_example

#+vindex: org-agenda-use-time-grid
#+vindex: org-agenda-time-grid

The time grid can be turned on and off with the variable
~org-agenda-use-time-grid~, and can be configured with
~org-agenda-time-grid~.

*** Sorting of agenda items
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: The order of things
    :END:
#+cindex: sorting, of agenda items
#+cindex: priorities, of agenda items

Before being inserted into a view, the items are sorted.  How this is
done depends on the type of view.

- For the daily/weekly agenda, the items for each day are sorted.  The
  default order is to first collect all items containing an explicit
  time-of-day specification.  These entries will be shown at the
  beginning of the list, as a /schedule/ for the day.  After that,
  items remain grouped in categories, in the sequence given by
  ~org-agenda-files~.  Within each category, items are sorted by
  priority (see [[Priorities]]), which is composed of the base priority
  (2000 for priority {{{samp(A)}}}, 1000 for {{{samp(B)}}}, and 0 for
  {{{samp(C)}}}), plus additional increments for overdue scheduled or deadline items.

  #+vindex: org-agenda-files

- For the TODO list, items remain in the order of categories, but
  within each category, sorting takes place according to priority (see
  [[Priorities]]).  The priority used for sorting derives from the
  priority cookie, with additions depending on how close an item is to
  its due or scheduled date.

- For tags matches, items are not sorted at all, but just appear in
  the sequence in which they are found in the agenda files.


#+vindex: org-agenda-sorting-strategy

Sorting can be customized using the variable
~org-agenda-sorting-strategy~, and may also include criteria based on
the estimated effort of an entry (see [[Effort estimates]]).

** FIXME Agenda commands

#+cindex: commands, in agenda buffer

Entries in the agenda buffer are linked back to the Org file or diary
file where they originate.  You are not allowed to edit the agenda
buffer itself, but commands are provided to show and jump to the
original entry location, and to edit the Org files ``remotely'' from
the agenda buffer.  In this way, all information is stored only once,
removing the risk that your agenda and note files may diverge.

Some commands can be executed with mouse clicks on agenda lines.  For
the other commands, the cursor needs to be in the desired line.

  #+vindex: org-agenda-start-with-follow-mode

  Toggle Follow mode.  In Follow mode, as you move the cursor through the
  agenda buffer, the other window always shows the corresponding
  location in the Org file.  The initial setting for this mode in new
  agenda buffers can be set with the variable
  ~org-agenda-start-with-follow-mode~.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-x b)}}}, ~org-agenda-tree-to-indirect-buffer~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x b

  Display the entire subtree of the current item in an indirect buffer.
  With a numeric prefix argument N, go up to level N and then take that

  prefix, do not remove the previously used indirect buffer.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-o)}}}, ~org-agenda-open-link~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-o

  Follow a link in the entry.  This will offer a selection of any links

  Switch to day view.  When switching to day view, this setting becomes
  the default for subsequent agenda refreshes.  A numeric prefix argument
  may be used to jump directly to a specific day of the year.  For
  example, {{{kbd(32 d)}}} jumps to February 1st.  When setting day view,
  a year may be encoded in the prefix argument as well.  For example,
  {{{kbd(200712 d)}}} will jump to January 12, 2007.  If such a year
  specification has only one or two digits, it will be mapped to the
  interval 1938-2037.

- {{{kbd(v w)}}} or short {{{kbd(w)}}}, ~org-agenda-week-view~ ::
  #+kindex: v w
  #+kindex: w
  #+vindex: org-agenda-span

  Switch to week view.  When switching week view, this setting becomes
  the default for subsequent agenda refreshes.  A numeric prefix argument
  may be used to jump directly to a specific day of the ISO week.  For
  example {{{kbd(9 w)}}} to ISO week number 9.  When setting week view, a
  year may be encoded in the prefix argument as well.  For example,
  {{{kbd(200712 w)}}} will jump to week 12 in 2007.  If such a year
  specification has only one or two digits, it will be mapped to the
  interval 1938-2037.

- {{{kbd(v m)}}}, ~org-agenda-month-view~ ::
  #+kindex: v m
  #+vindex: org-agenda-span

  Switch to month view.  Because month views are slow to create, they do
  not become the default for subsequent agenda refreshes.  A numeric
  prefix argument may be used to jump directly to a specific day of the
  month.  When setting month view, a year may be encoded in the prefix
  argument as well.  For example, {{{kbd(200712 m)}}} will jump to
  December, 2007.  If such a year specification has only one or two
  digits, it will be mapped to the interval 1938-2037.

- {{{kbd(v y)}}}, ~org-agenda-year-view~ ::
  #+kindex: v y
  #+vindex: org-agenda-span

  Switch to year view.  Because year views are slow to create, they do
  not become the default for subsequent agenda refreshes.  A numeric
  prefix argument may be used to jump directly to a specific day of the
  year.

- {{{kbdspckey(v,SPC)}}}, ~org-agenda-reset-view~ ::
  #+kindex: v @key{SPC}
  #+vindex: org-agenda-span

  Reset ~org-agenda-span~ to the current span.

- {{{kbd(f)}}}, ~org-agenda-later~ ::
  #+kindex: f

  Go forward in time to display the following ~org-agenda-current-span~
  days.  For example, if the display covers a week, switch to the
  following week.  With prefix arg, go forward that many times
  ~org-agenda-current-span~ days.

- {{{kbd(b)}}}, ~org-agenda-earlier~ ::
  #+kindex: b

  Go backward in time to display earlier dates.

- {{{kbd(.)}}}, ~org-agenda-goto-today~ ::
  #+kindex: .

  Go to today.

- {{{kbd(j)}}}, ~org-agenda-goto-date~ ::
  #+kindex: j
  
  Prompt for a date and go there.

- {{{kbd(J)}}}, ~org-agenda-clock-goto~ ::
  #+kindex: J

   Go to the currently clocked-in task /in the agenda buffer/.

- {{{kbd(D)}}}, ~org-agenda-toggle-diary~ ::
  #+kindex: D

   Toggle the inclusion of diary entries.  See [[Weekly/daily agenda]].

  #+vindex: org-agenda-log-mode-items

  Toggle Logbook mode.  In Logbook mode, entries that were marked DONE
  while logging was on (see the variable ~org-log-done~) are shown in
  the agenda, as are entries that have been clocked on that day.  You can
  configure the entry types that should be included in log mode using
  the variable ~org-agenda-log-mode-items~.  When called with a
  {{{kbd(C-u)}}} prefix, show all possible logbook entries, including
  state changes.  When called with two prefix args {{{kbd(C-u C-u)}}},
  show only logging information, nothing else.  {{{kbd(v L)}}} is
  equivalent to {{{kbd(C-u v l)}}}.

- {{{kbd(v [)}}} or short {{{kbd([)}}}, ~org-agenda-manipulate-query-add~ ::
  #+kindex: v [
  #+kindex: [

  Include inactive timestamps into the current view.  Only for
  weekly/daily agenda and timeline views.

- {{{kbd(v a)}}}, ~org-agenda-archives-mode~ ::
  #+kindex: v a

  Toggle Archives mode.  In Archives mode, trees that are marked
  ~ARCHIVED~ are also scanned when producing the agenda.  To exit
  archives mode, press {{{kbd(v a)}}} again.

- {{{kbd(v A)}}}, ~org-agenda-archives-mode 'files~ ::

  Toggle Archives mode.  In Archives mode, trees that are marked
  ~ARCHIVED~ are also scanned when producing the agenda, including all
  archive files.  To exit archives mode, press {{{kbd(v a)}}}.

- {{{kbd(v R)}}} or short {{{kbd(R)}}}, ~org-agenda-clockreport-mode~ ::
  #+kindex: v R
  #+kindex: R
  #+vindex: org-agenda-start-with-clockreport-mode
  #+vindex: org-clock-report-include-clocking-task

  Toggle Clockreport mode.  In Clockreport mode, the daily/weekly agenda
  will always show a table with the clocked times for the timespan and
  file scope covered by the current agenda view.  The initial setting for
  this mode in new agenda buffers can be set with the variable
  ~org-agenda-start-with-clockreport-mode~.  By using a prefix argument
  when toggling this mode (i.e., {{{kbd(C-u R)}}}), the clock table will
  not show contributions from entries that are hidden by agenda
  filtering.[fn:94] See also the variable
  ~org-clock-report-include-clocking-task~.

- {{{kbd(v c)}}} ::
  #+kindex: v c
  #+vindex: org-agenda-clock-consistency-checks

  Show overlapping clock entries, clocking gaps, and other clocking
  problems in the current agenda range.  You can then visit clocking
  lines and fix them manually.  See the variable
  ~org-agenda-clock-consistency-checks~ for information on how to
  customize the definition of what constituted a clocking problem.  To
  return to normal agenda display, press {{{kbd(l)}}} to exit Logbook
  mode.

- {{{kbd(v E)}}} or short {{{kbd(E)}}}, ~org-agenda-entry-text-mode~ ::
  #+kindex: v E
  #+kindex: E
  #+vindex: org-agenda-start-with-entry-text-mode
  #+vindex: org-agenda-entry-text-maxlines

  Toggle entry text mode.  In entry text mode, a number of lines from the
  Org outline node referenced by an agenda line will be displayed below
  the line.  The maximum number of lines is given by the variable
  ~org-agenda-entry-text-maxlines~.  Calling this command with a numeric
  prefix argument will temporarily modify that number to the prefix
  value.

- {{{kbd(G)}}}, ~org-agenda-toggle-time-grid~ ::
  #+kindex: G
  #+vindex: org-agenda-use-time-grid
  #+vindex: org-agenda-time-grid

  Toggle the time grid on and off.  See also the variables
  ~org-agenda-use-time-grid~ and ~org-agenda-time-grid~.

- {{{kbd(r)}}}, ~org-agenda-redo~ ::
  #+kindex: r

  Recreate the agenda buffer, for example to reflect the changes after
  modification of the timestamps of items with {{{kbdkey(S-,left)}}} and
  {{{kbdkey(S-,right)}}}.  When the buffer is the global TODO list, a prefix
  argument is interpreted to create a selective list for a specific TODO
  keyword.

- {{{kbd(g)}}}, ~org-agenda-redo~ ::
  #+kindex: g

  Same as {{{kbd(r)}}}.

- {{{kbd(C-x C-s)}}} or short {{{kbd(s)}}}, ~org-save-all-org-buffers~ ::
  #+kindex: C-x C-s
  #+kindex: s

  Save all Org buffers in the current Emacs session, and also the
  locations of IDs.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-c)}}}, ~org-agenda-columns~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x C-c
  #+vindex: org-columns-default-format

  Invoke column view (see [[Column view]]) in the agenda buffer.  The column
  view format is taken from the entry at point, or (if there is no entry
  at point), from the first entry in the agenda view.  So whatever the
  format for that entry would be in the original buffer (taken from a
  property, from a ~#+COLUMNS~ line, or from the default variable
  ~org-columns-default-format~), will be used in the agenda.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-x >)}}}, ~org-agenda-remove-restriction-lock~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x >

  Remove the restriction lock on the agenda, if it is currently
  restricted to a file or subtree (see [[Agenda files]]).

*** FIXME Secondary filtering and query editing
#+cindex: filtering, by tag category and effort, in agenda
#+cindex: tag filtering, in agenda

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(<)}}}, ~org-agenda-filter-by-category~ ::
  #+kindex: <
  #+vindex: org-agenda-category-filter-preset

  Filter the current agenda view with respect to the category of the
  item at point.  Pressing {{{kbd(<)}}} another time will remove this
  filter.  You can add a filter preset through the option
  ~org-agenda-category-filter-preset~ (see below).

- {{{kbd(/)}}}, ~org-agenda-filter-by-tag~ ::
  #+kindex: /
  #+vindex: org-agenda-tag-filter-preset

  Filter the current agenda view with respect to a tag and/or effort
  estimates.  The difference between this and a custom agenda command is
  that filtering is very fast, so that you can switch quickly between
  different filters without having to recreate the
  agenda.[fn:95]

  You will be prompted for a tag selection letter; {{{key(SPC)}}} will
  mean any tag at all.  Pressing {{{key(TAB)}}} at that prompt will offer
  use completion to select a tag (including any tags that do not have a
  selection character).  The command then hides all entries that do not
  contain or inherit this tag.  When called with prefix arg, remove the
  entries that /do/ have the tag.  A second {{{kbd(/)}}} at the prompt
  will turn off the filter and unhide any hidden entries.  If the first
  key you press is either {{{kbd(+)}}} or {{{kbd(-)}}}, the previous
  filter will be narrowed by requiring or forbidding the selected
  additional tag.  Instead of pressing {{{kbd(+)}}} or {{{kbd(-)}}} after
  {{{kbd(/)}}}, you can also immediately use the ~\~ command.

  #+vindex: org-sort-agenda-noeffort-is-high

  In order to filter for effort estimates, you should set up allowed
  efforts globally, for example:
  #+header: :eval no
  #+header: :exports code
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-global-properties
      '(("Effort_ALL". "0 0:10 0:30 1:00 2:00 3:00 4:00")))
  #+end_src

  You can then filter for an effort by first typing an operator, one of
  {{{kbd(<)}}}, {{{kbd(>)}}}, and {{{kbd(=)}}}, and then the one-digit
  index of an effort estimate in your array of allowed values, where
  {{{kbd(0)}}} means the 10th value.  The filter will then restrict to
  entries with effort smaller-or-equal, equal, or larger-or-equal than
  the selected value.  If the digits 0-9 are not used as fast access keys
  to tags, you can also simply press the index digit directly without an
  operator.  In this case, {{{kbd(<)}}} will be assumed.  For application
  of the operator, entries without a defined effort will be treated
  according to the value of ~org-sort-agenda-noeffort-is-high~.  To
  filter for tasks without effort definition, press {{{kbd(?)}}} as the
  operator.

  Org also supports automatic, context-aware tag filtering.  If the
  variable ~org-agenda-auto-exclude-function~ is set to a user-defined
  function, that function can decide which tags should be excluded from
  the agenda automatically.  Once this is set, the {{{kbd(/)}}} command
  then accepts {{{kbd(RET)}}} as a sub-option key and runs the auto
  exclusion logic.  For example, let's say you use a ~Net~ tag to
  identify tasks which need network access, an ~Errand~ tag for errands
  in town, and a ~Call~ tag for making phone calls.  You could
  auto-exclude these tags based on the availability of the Internet, and
  outside of business hours, with something like this:

  #+header: :eval no
  #+header: :exports code
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun org-my-auto-exclude-function (tag)
    (and (cond
          ((string= tag "Net")
           (/= 0 (call-process "/sbin/ping" nil nil nil
                               "-c1" "-q" "-t1" "mail.gnu.org")))
          ((or (string= tag "Errand") (string= tag "Call"))
           (let ((hour (nth 2 (decode-time))))
             (or (< hour 8) (> hour 21)))))
         (concat "-" tag)))
  (setq org-agenda-auto-exclude-function 'org-my-auto-exclude-function)
  #+end_src

- ~\~ ~org-agenda-filter-by-tag-refine~ ::
  #+kindex: XXX
  #+comment: Should be \
  Narrow the current agenda filter by an additional condition.  When
  called with prefix arg, remove the entries that /do/ have the tag, or
  that do match the effort criterion.  You can achieve the same effect by
  pressing {{{kbd(+)}}} or {{{kbd(-)}}} as the first key after the
  {{{kbd(/)}}} command.

- {{{kbd([)}}} {{{kbd(])}}} {{{kbd({)}}} {{{kbd(})}}} in search view ::
  #+kindex: [
  #+kindex: ]
  #+kindex: @{
  #+kindex: @}

  Add new search words ({{{kbd([)}}} and {{{kbd(])}}}) or new regular
  expressions ({{{kbd({)}}} and {{{kbd(})}}}) to the query string.  The
  opening bracket/brace will add a positive search term prefixed by
  {{{samp(+)}}}, indicating that this search term /must/ occur/match in
  the entry.  The closing bracket/brace will add a negative search term
  which /must not/ occur/match in the entry for it to be selected.

  Move the subtree corresponding to the current entry to its /archive
  sibling/.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-s)}}} or short {{{kbd($)}}}, ~org-agenda-archive~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x C-s
  #+kindex: $

  Archive the subtree corresponding to the current headline.  This means
  the entry will be moved to the configured archive location, most
  likely a different file.

- {{{kbd(T)}}}, ~org-agenda-show-tags~ ::
  #+kindex: T
  #+vindex: org-agenda-show-inherited-tags

  Show all tags associated with the current item.  This is useful if you
  have turned off ~org-agenda-show-inherited-tags~, but still want to
  see all tags of a headline occasionally.

- {{{kbd(:)}}}, ~org-agenda-set-tags~ ::
  #+kindex: :

  Set tags for the current headline.  If there is an active region in the
  agenda, change a tag for all headings in the region.

- {{{kbd(\\\,)}}} ::
  #+kindex: ,
  Set the priority for the current item (~org-agenda-priority~).  Org
  mode prompts for the priority character.  If you reply with
  {{{key(SPC)}}}, the priority cookie is removed from the entry.

- {{{kbd(P)}}}, ~org-agenda-show-priority~ ::
  #+kindex: P

  Display weighted priority of current item.

- {{{kbd(+)}}} {{{kbdkey(S-,up)}}}, ~org-agenda-priority-up~ ::

- {{{kbdkey(S-,right)}}}, ~org-agenda-do-date-later~ ::
  #+kindex: S-@key{right}

  Change the timestamp associated with the current line by one day into
  the future.  If the date is in the past, the first call to this command
  will move it to today.  With a numeric prefix argument, change it by
  that many days.  For example, {{{kbdkey(3 6 5 S-,right)}}} will change
  it by a year.  With a {{{kbd(C-u)}}} prefix, change the time by one
  hour.  If you immediately repeat the command, it will continue to
  change hours even without the prefix arg.  With a double 
  {{{kbd(C-u C-u)}}} prefix, do the same for changing minutes.  The stamp is changed
  in the original Org file, but the change is not directly reflected in
  the agenda buffer.  Use {{{kbd(r)}}} or {{{kbd(g)}}} to update the
  buffer.

- {{{kbdkey(S-,left)}}}, ~org-agenda-do-date-earlier~ ::

  Bulk action: act on all marked entries in the agenda.  This will prompt
  for another key to select the action to be applied.  The prefix arg to
  {{{kbd(B)}}} will be passed through to the {{{kbd(s)}}} and
  {{{kbd(d)}}} commands, to bulk-remove these special timestamps.  By
  default, marks are removed after the bulk.  If you want them to
  persist, set ~org-agenda-bulk-persistent-marks~ to ~t~ or hit
  {{{kbd(p)}}} at the prompt.

  - {{{kbd(*)}}} ::  

    Toggle persistent marks.

    the state of all selected entries, bypassing blocking and suppressing
    logging notes (but not timestamps).

  - {{{kbd(+)}}}  :: 

    Add a tag to all selected entries.

  - {{{kbd(-)}}}  :: 

    Remove a tag from all selected entries.

  - {{{kbd(s)}}}  ::

*** Calendar commands
#+cindex: calendar commands, from agenda

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis

  When in the calendar, compute and show the Org mode agenda for the
  date at the cursor.

- {{{kbd(i)}}}, ~org-agenda-diary-entry~ ::
  #+kindex: i
  #+vindex: org-agenda-diary-file
  #+cindex: diary entries, creating from agenda

  Insert a new entry into the diary, using the date at the cursor and
  (for block entries) the date at the mark.  This will add to the Emacs
  diary file, in a way similar to the {{{kbd(i)}}} command in the
  calendar.[fn:97] The diary file will pop up in another window, where
  you can add the entry.

  If you configure ~org-agenda-diary-file~ to point to an Org mode file,
  Org will create entries (in Org mode syntax) in that file instead.
  Most entries will be stored in a date-based outline tree that will
  later make it easy to archive appointments from previous months/years.
  The tree will be built under an entry with a ~DATE_TREE~ property, or
  else with years as top-level entries.  Emacs will prompt you for the
  entry text---if you specify it, the entry will be created in
  ~org-agenda-diary-file~ without further interaction.  If you directly
  press {{{key(RET)}}} at the prompt without typing text, the target
  file will be shown in another window for you to finish the entry
  there.  See also the {{{kbd(k r)}}} command.

- {{{kbd(M)}}}, ~org-agenda-phases-of-moon~ ::
  #+kindex: M

  Show the phases of the moon for the three months around current date.

- {{{kbd(S)}}}, ~org-agenda-sunrise-sunset~ ::

  #+vindex: org-agenda-exporter-settings

  Write the agenda view to a file.  Depending on the extension of the
  selected file name, the view will be exported as HTML (extension
  {{{file(.html)}}} or {{{file(.htm)}}}), Postscript (extension
  {{{file(.ps)}}}), PDF (extension {{{file(.pdf)}}}), and plain text
  (any other extension).  When called with a {{{kbd(C-u)}}} prefix
  argument, immediately open the newly created file.  Use the variable
  ~org-agenda-exporter-settings~ to set options for {{{file(ps-print)}}}
  and for {{{file(htmlize)}}} to be used during export.

*** Quit and exit
#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis

- {{{kbd(x)}}}, ~org-agenda-exit~ ::
  #+kindex: x
  #+cindex: agenda files, removing buffers

  Exit agenda, remove the agenda buffer and all buffers loaded by Emacs

** Custom agenda views
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Defining special searches and views
   :END:
#+cindex: custom agenda views
#+cindex: agenda views, custom

Custom agenda commands serve two purposes: to store and quickly access
frequently used TODO and tags searches, and to create special composite
agenda buffers.  Custom agenda commands will be accessible through the
dispatcher (see [[Agenda dispatcher]]), just like the default commands.

*** Storing searches
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Type once, use often
    :END:

The first application of custom searches is the definition of keyboard
shortcuts for frequently used searches, either creating an agenda
buffer, or a sparse tree (the latter covering of course only the
current buffer).

#+kindex: C-c a C
#+vindex: org-agenda-custom-commands

Custom commands are configured in the variable
~org-agenda-custom-commands~.  You can customize this variable, for
example by pressing {{{kbd(C-c a C)}}}.  You can also directly set it
with Emacs Lisp in {{{file(.emacs)}}}.  The following example contains
all valid search types:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("w" todo "WAITING")
        ("W" todo-tree "WAITING")
        ("u" tags "+boss-urgent")
        ("v" tags-todo "+boss-urgent")
        ("U" tags-tree "+boss-urgent")
        ("f" occur-tree "\\<FIXME\\>")
        ("h" . "HOME+Name tags searches") ; description for "h" prefix
        ("hl" tags "+home+Lisa")
        ("hp" tags "+home+Peter")
        ("hk" tags "+home+Kim")))
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} The initial string in each entry defines the keys you
have to press after the dispatcher command {{{kbd(C-c a)}}} in order
to access the command.  Usually this will be just a single character,
but if you have many similar commands, you can also define two-letter
combinations where the first character is the same in several
combinations and serves as a prefix key.[fn:98] The second parameter
is the search type, followed by the string or regular expression to be
used for the matching.  The example above will therefore define:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @kbd
- C-c a w ::

  A global search for TODO entries with {{{samp(WAITING)}}} as the TODO
  keyword.

- C-c a W ::

  The same search, but only in the current buffer and displaying the
  results as a sparse tree.

- C-c a u ::

  A global tags search for headlines marked {{{samp(:boss:)}}} but not
  {{{samp(:urgent:)}}}.

- C-c a v ::

  The same search as {{{kbd(C-c a u)}}}, but limiting the search to
  headlines that are also TODO items.

- C-c a U ::

  The same search as {{{kbd(C-c a u)}}}, but only in the current buffer and
  displaying the result as a sparse tree.

- C-c a f ::

  Create a sparse tree (again: current buffer only) with all entries
  containing the word {{{samp(FIXME)}}}

- C-c a h ::

  A prefix command for a HOME tags search where you have to press an
  additional key ({{{kbd(l)}}}, {{{kbd(p)}}} or {{{kbd(k)}}}) to select
  a name (Lisa, Peter, or Kim) as additional tag to match.


*** Block agenda
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: All the stuff you need in a single buffer
    :END:
#+cindex: block agenda
#+cindex: agenda, with block views

Another possibility is the construction of agenda views that comprise
the results of /several/ commands, each of which creates a block in
the agenda buffer.  The available commands include ~agenda~ for the
daily or weekly agenda (as created with {{{kbd(C-c a a)}}}), ~alltodo~
for the global TODO list (as constructed with {{{kbd(C-c a t)}}}), and
the matching commands discussed above: ~todo~, ~tags~, and
~tags-todo~.  Here are two examples:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
         ((agenda "")
          (tags-todo "home")
          (tags "garden")))
        ("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
         ((agenda "")
          (tags-todo "work")
          (tags "office")))))
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} This will define {{{kbd(C-c a h)}}} to create a
multi-block view for stuff you need to attend to at home.  The
resulting agenda buffer will contain your agenda for the current week,
all TODO items that carry the tag {{{samp(home)}}}, and also all lines
tagged with {{{samp(garden)}}}.  Finally the command {{{kbd(C-c a o)}}}
provides a similar view for office tasks.

*** Setting options for custom commands
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Changing the rules
    :END:
#+cindex: options, for custom agenda views
#+vindex: org-agenda-custom-commands

Org mode contains a number of variables regulating agenda construction
and display.  The global variables define the behavior for all agenda
commands, including the custom commands.  However, if you want to
change some settings just for a single custom view, you can do so.
Setting options requires inserting a list of variable names and values
at the right spot in ~org-agenda-custom-commands~.  For example:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("w" todo "WAITING"
         ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-down))
          (org-agenda-prefix-format "  Mixed: ")))
        ("U" tags-tree "+boss-urgent"
         ((org-show-following-heading nil)
          (org-show-hierarchy-above nil)))
        ("N" search ""
         ((org-agenda-files '("~org/notes.org"))
          (org-agenda-text-search-extra-files nil)))))
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} Now the {{{kbd(C-c a w)}}} command will sort the
collected entries only by priority, and the prefix format is modified
to just say {{{samp( Mixed: )}}} instead of giving the category of the
entry.  The sparse tags tree of {{{kbd(C-c a U)}}} will now turn out
ultra-compact, because neither the headline hierarchy above the match,
nor the headline following the match will be shown.  The command
{{{kbd(C-c a N)}}} will do a text search limited to only a single
file.

#+vindex: org-agenda-custom-commands

For command sets creating a block agenda, ~org-agenda-custom-commands~
has two separate spots for setting options.  You can add options that
should be valid for just a single command in the set, and options that
should be valid for all commands in the set.  The former are just added
to the command entry; the latter must come after the list of command
entries.  Going back to the block agenda example (see [[Block
agenda]]), let's change the sorting strategy for the {{{kbd(C-c a
h)}}} commands to ~priority-down~, but let's sort the results for
GARDEN tags query in the opposite order, ~priority-up~.  This would
look like this:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
         ((agenda)
          (tags-todo "home")
          (tags "garden"
                ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-up)))))
         ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-down))))
        ("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
         ((agenda)
          (tags-todo "work")
          (tags "office")))))
#+end_src

As you see, the values and parentheses setting is a little complex.
When in doubt, use the customize interface to set this variable---it
fully supports its structure.  Just one caveat: when setting options in
this interface, the /values/ are just Lisp expressions.  So if the
value is a string, you need to add the double-quotes around the value
yourself.

#+vindex: org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts

To control whether an agenda command should be accessible from a
specific context, you can customize
~org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts~.  Let's say for example that you
have an agenda command {{{kbd(o)}}} displaying a view that you only
need when reading emails.  Then you would configure this option like
this:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts
      '(("o" (in-mode . "message-mode"))))
#+end_src

You can also tell that the command key {{{kbd(o)}}} should refer to another
command key {{{kbd(r)}}}.  In that case, add this command key like this:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts
      '(("o" "r" (in-mode . "message-mode"))))
#+end_src

See the docstring of the variable for more information.

** Exporting agenda views
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Writing a view to a file
   :END:
#+cindex: agenda views, exporting

If you are away from your computer, it can be very useful to have a
printed version of some agenda views to carry around.  Org mode can
export custom agenda views as plain text, HTML, Postscript,
PDF, and iCalendar files.[fn:99] If you want to
do this only occasionally, use the following command:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-x C-w)}}}, ~org-agenda-write~ ::

  #+cindex: exporting agenda views
  #+cindex: agenda views, exporting
  #+vindex: org-agenda-exporter-settings

  Write the agenda view to a file.  Depending on the extension of the
  selected file name, the view will be exported as HTML (extension
  {{{file(.html)}}} or {{{file(.htm)}}}), Postscript (extension
  {{{file(.ps)}}}), iCalendar (extension {{{file(.ics)}}}), or plain
  text (any other extension).  Use the variable
  ~org-agenda-exporter-settings~ to set options for {{{file(ps-print)}}}
  and for {{{file(htmlize)}}} to be used during export, for example:

  #+vindex: org-agenda-add-entry-text-maxlines
  #+vindex: htmlize-output-type
  #+vindex: ps-number-of-columns
  #+vindex: ps-landscape-mode

  #+header: :eval no
  #+header: :exports code
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-agenda-exporter-settings
        '((ps-number-of-columns 2)
          (ps-landscape-mode t)
          (org-agenda-add-entry-text-maxlines 5)
          (htmlize-output-type 'css)))
  #+end_src


If you need to export certain agenda views frequently, you can
associate any custom agenda command with a list of output file
names.[fn:100] Here is an example that first defines custom commands
for the agenda and the global TODO list, together with a number of
files to which to export them.  Then we define two block agenda
commands and specify file names for them as well.  File names can be
relative to the current working directory, or absolute.

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("X" agenda "" nil ("agenda.html" "agenda.ps"))
        ("Y" alltodo "" nil ("todo.html" "todo.txt" "todo.ps"))
        ("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
         ((agenda "")
          (tags-todo "home")
          (tags "garden"))
         nil
         ("~/views/home.html"))
        ("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
         ((agenda)
          (tags-todo "work")
          (tags "office"))
         nil
         ("~/views/office.ps" "~/calendars/office.ics"))))
#+end_src

The extension of the file name determines the type of export.  If it is
{{{file(.html)}}}, Org mode will use the {{{file(htmlize.el)}}}
package to convert the buffer to HTML and save it to this file name.
If the extension is {{{file(.ps)}}}, ~ps-print-buffer-with-faces~ is
used to produce Postscript output.  If the extension is
{{{file(.ics)}}}, iCalendar export is run export over all files that
were used to construct the agenda, and limit the export to entries
listed in the agenda.  Any other extension produces a plain ASCII file.

The export files are /not/ created when you use one of those
commands interactively because this might use too much overhead.
Instead, there is a special command to produce /all/ specified
files in one step:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c a e)}}}, ~org-store-agenda-views~ ::

  Export all agenda views that have export file names associated with
  them.


You can use the options section of the custom agenda commands to also
set options for the export commands.  For example:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("X" agenda ""
         ((ps-number-of-columns 2)
          (ps-landscape-mode t)
          (org-agenda-prefix-format " [ ] ")
          (org-agenda-with-colors nil)
          (org-agenda-remove-tags t))
         ("theagenda.ps"))))
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} This command sets two options for the Postscript
exporter, to make it print in two columns in landscape format---the
resulting page can be cut in two and then used in a paper agenda.  The
remaining settings modify the agenda prefix to omit category and
scheduling information, and instead include a checkbox to check off
items.  We also remove the tags to make the lines compact, and we don't
want to use colors for the black-and-white printer.  Settings specified
in ~org-agenda-exporter-settings~ will also apply, but the settings in
~org-agenda-custom-commands~ take precedence.

{{{noindent}}} From the command line you may also use:

#+begin_src sh
  emacs -eval (org-batch-store-agenda-views) -kill
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} or, if you need to modify some parameters:[fn:101]

#+begin_example
   emacs -eval '(org-batch-store-agenda-views                      \
                 org-agenda-span (quote month)                     \
                 org-agenda-start-day "2007-11-01"                 \
                 org-agenda-include-diary nil                      \
                 org-agenda-files (quote ("~/org/project.org")))'  \
         -kill
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} which will create the agenda views restricted to the
file {{{file(~/org/project.org)}}}, without diary entries and with a
30-day extent.

You can also extract agenda information in a way that allows further
processing by other programs.  See [[Extracting agenda information]], for
more information.

** Using column view in the agenda
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Using column view for collected entries
   :ALT_TITLE: Agenda column view
   :END:
#+cindex: column view, in agenda
#+cindex: agenda, column view
<<Agenda column view>>

Column view (see [[Column view]]) is normally used to view and edit
properties embedded in the hierarchical structure of an Org file.  It
can be quite useful to use column view also from the agenda, where
entries are collected by certain criteria.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-c)}}}, ~org-agenda-columns~ ::

  Turn on column view in the agenda.


To understand how to use this properly, it is important to realize that the
entries in the agenda are no longer in their proper outline environment.
This causes the following issues:

1. Org needs to make a decision which ~COLUMNS~ format to use.  Since
   the entries in the agenda are collected from different files, and
   different files may have different ~COLUMNS~ formats, this is a
   non-trivial problem.  Org first checks if the variable
   ~org-agenda-overriding-columns-format~ is currently set, and if so,
   takes the format from there.  Otherwise it takes the format
   associated with the first item in the agenda, or, if that item does
   not have a specific format (defined in a property, or in its file),
   it uses ~org-columns-default-format~.

   #+vindex: org-columns-default-format
   #+vindex: org-overriding-columns-format

2. If any of the columns has a summary type defined (see [[Column
   attributes]]), turning on column view in the agenda will visit all
   relevant agenda files and make sure that the computations of this
   property are up to date.  This is also true for the special
   ~CLOCKSUM~ property.  Org will then sum the values displayed in the
   agenda.  In the daily/weekly agenda, the sums will cover a single
   day; in all other views they cover the entire block.  It is vital to
   realize that the agenda may show the same entry /twice/ (for
   example as scheduled and as a deadline), and it may show two
   entries from the same hierarchy (for example a /parent/ and its
   /child/).  In these cases, the summation in the agenda will lead to
   incorrect results because some values will count double.

   #+cindex: property, special, CLOCKSUM

3. When the column view in the agenda shows the ~CLOCKSUM~, that is
   always the entire clocked time for this item.  So even in the
   daily/weekly agenda, the clocksum listed in column view may
   originate from times outside the current view.  This has the
   advantage that you can compare these values with a column listing
   the planned total effort for a task---one of the major applications
   for column view in the agenda.  If you want information about
   clocked time in the displayed period use clock table mode (press
   {{{kbd(R)}}} in the agenda).

4. When the column view in the agenda shows the ~CLOCKSUM_T~, that is
   always today's clocked time for this item.  So even in the weekly agenda,
   the clocksum listed in column view only originates from today.  This lets
   you compare the time you spent on a task for today, with the time already
   spent (via ~CLOCKSUM~) and with the planned total effort for it.

   #+cindex: property, special, CLOCKSUM_T

* FIXME Markup for rich export
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: Prepare text for rich export
  :ALT_TITLE: Markup
  :END:

When exporting Org mode documents, the exporter tries to reflect the
structure of the document as accurately as possible in the backend.
Since export targets like HTML, LaTeX, or DocBook allow much richer
formatting, Org mode has rules on how to prepare text for rich export.
This section summarizes the markup rules used in an Org mode buffer.

** Structural markup elements
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: The basic structure as seen by the exporter
   :END:

*** Document title
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Where the title is taken from
    :END:
#+cindex: document title, markup rules

{{{noindent}}} The title of the exported document is taken from the
special line:

#+cindex: #+TITLE
#+begin_example
   ,#+TITLE: This is the title of the document
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} If this line does not exist, the title is derived from
the first non-empty, non-comment line in the buffer.  If no such line
exists, or if you have turned off exporting of the text before the
first headline (see below), the title will be the file name without
extension.

#+cindex: property, EXPORT_TITLE

If you are exporting only a subtree by marking is as the region, the
heading of the subtree will become the title of the document.  If the
subtree has a property ~EXPORT_TITLE~, that will take precedence.

*** Headings and sections
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: The document structure as seen by the exporter
    :END:
#+cindex: headings and sections, markup rules

#+vindex: org-export-headline-levels

The outline structure of the document as described in [[Document
structure]], forms the basis for defining sections of the exported
document.  However, since the outline structure is also used for (for
example) lists of tasks, only the first three outline levels will be
used as headings.  Deeper levels will become itemized lists.  You can
change the location of this switch globally by setting the variable
~org-export-headline-levels~, or on a per-file basis with the ~H~ option:

#+cindex: #+OPTIONS
#+begin_example
   ,#+OPTIONS: H:4
#+end_example

*** Table of contents
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: The if and where of the table of contents
    :END:
#+cindex: table of contents, markup rules

#+vindex: org-export-with-toc

The table of contents is normally inserted directly before the first
headline of the file.  If you would like to get it to a different
location, insert the string ~[TABLE-OF-CONTENTS]~ on a line by itself
at the desired location.  The depth of the table of contents is by
default the same as the number of headline levels, but you can choose
a smaller number, or turn off the table of contents entirely, by
configuring the variable ~org-export-with-toc~, or on a per-file basis
with the ~toc~ option:

#+begin_example
   ,#+OPTIONS: toc:2          (only to two levels in TOC)
   ,#+OPTIONS: toc:nil        (no TOC at all)
#+end_example

*** Initial text
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Text before the first heading?
    :TITLE:    Text before the first headline
    :END:
#+cindex: text before first headline, markup rules
#+cindex: #+TEXT

Org mode normally exports the text before the first headline, and even uses
the first line as the document title.  The text will be fully marked up.  If
you need to include literal HTML, LaTeX, or DocBook code, use the special
constructs described below in the sections for the individual exporters.

#+vindex: org-export-skip-text-before-1st-heading

Some people like to use the space before the first headline for setup
and internal links and therefore would like to control the exported
text before the first headline in a different way.  You can do so by
setting the variable ~org-export-skip-text-before-1st-heading~ to ~t~.
On a per-file basis, you can get the same effect with
{{{samp(#+OPTIONS: skip:t)}}}.

{{{noindent}}}

If you still want to have some text before the first headline, use the
~#+TEXT~ construct:

#+begin_example
   ,#+OPTIONS: skip:t
   ,#+TEXT: This text will go before the *first* headline.
   ,#+TEXT: [TABLE-OF-CONTENTS]
   ,#+TEXT: This goes between the table of contents and the *first* headline
#+end_example

*** Lists
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Lists
    :END:
#+cindex: lists, markup rules

Plain lists as described in [[Plain lists]], are translated to the
backend's syntax for such lists.  Most backends support unordered,
ordered, and description lists.

*** Paragraphs
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Paragraphs
    :END:
#+cindex: paragraphs, markup rules

Paragraphs are separated by at least one empty line.  If you need to
enforce a line break within a paragraph, use ~\\~ at the end
of a line.

To keep the line breaks in a region, but otherwise use normal
formatting, you can use ~VERSE~ blocks, which can also be used to
format poetry:

#+cindex: #+BEGIN_VERSE
#+begin_example
   #+BEGIN_VERSE
    Great clouds overhead
    Tiny black birds rise and fall
    Snow covers Emacs

        -- AlexSchroeder
   #+END_VERSE
#+end_example

When quoting a passage from another document, it is customary to
format this as a paragraph that is indented on both the left and the
right margin.  You can include quotations in Org mode documents like
this:

#+cindex: #+BEGIN_QUOTE
#+begin_example
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Everything should be made as simple as possible,
   but not any simpler -- Albert Einstein
   #+END_QUOTE
#+end_example

If you would like to center some text, do it like this:
#+cindex: #+BEGIN_CENTER
#+begin_example
   #+BEGIN_CENTER
   Everything should be made as simple as possible, \\
   but not any simpler
   #+END_CENTER
#+end_example

*** Footnote markup
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Footnotes
    :END:
#+cindex: footnotes, markup rules
#+cindex: @file{footnote.el}

Footnotes defined in the way described in [[Creating footnotes]], will be exported
by all backends.  Org allows multiple references to the same note, and
multiple footnotes side by side.

*** Emphasis and monospace
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Bold, italic, etc.
    :END:

#+cindex: underlined text, markup rules
#+cindex: bold text, markup rules
#+cindex: italic text, markup rules
#+cindex: verbatim text, markup rules
#+cindex: code text, markup rules
#+cindex: strike-through text, markup rules

You can make words **bold**, //italic//, _underlined_, ~=code=~
and ~~verbatim~~, and, if you must, {{{samp(+strike-through+)}}}.  Text
in the code and verbatim string is not processed for Org mode specific
syntax; it is exported verbatim.

*** Horizontal rules
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Make a line
    :END:
#+cindex: horizontal rules, markup rules

A line consisting of only dashes, and at least 5 of them, will be
exported as a horizontal line (~<hr/>~ in HTML and ~\hrule~
in LaTeX).

*** Comment lines
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: What will *not* be exported
    :END:
#+cindex: comment lines
#+cindex: exporting, not
#+cindex: #+BEGIN_COMMENT

Lines starting with zero or more whitespace characters followed by one
{{{samp(#)}}} and a whitespace are treated as comments and will never
be exported.  Also entire subtrees starting with the word
{{{samp(COMMENT)}}} will never be exported.  Finally, regions
surrounded by {{{samp(#+BEGIN_COMMENT)}}} ...
{{{samp(#+END_COMMENT)}}} will not be exported.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c ;)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c ;

  Toggle the COMMENT keyword at the beginning of an entry.

** Images and tables
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Tables and images can be exported
   :END:

#+cindex: tables, markup rules
#+cindex: #+CAPTION
#+cindex: #+LABEL

Both the native Org mode tables (see [[Tables]]) and tables formatted with
the {{{file(table.el)}}} package will be exported properly.  For Org
mode tables, the lines before the first horizontal separator line will
become table header lines.  You can use the following lines somewhere
before the table to assign a caption and a label for cross references,
and in the text you can refer to the object with
~\ref{tab:basic-data}~:

#+begin_example
   #+CAPTION: This is the caption for the next table (or link)
   #+LABEL:   tab:basic-data
      | ... | ...|
      |-----|----|
#+end_example

Optionally, the caption can take the form:
#+begin_example
   #+CAPTION: [Caption for list of figures]{Caption for table (or link).}
#+end_example

#+cindex: inlined images, markup rules

Some backends (HTML, LaTeX, and DocBook) allow you to directly
include images into the exported document.  Org does this, if a link to
an image files does not have a description part, for example
~[[./img/a.jpg]]~.  If you wish to define a caption for the image and maybe
a label for internal cross references, make sure that the link is on a
line by itself and precede it with ~#+CAPTION~ and ~#+LABEL~ as
follows:

#+begin_example
   #+CAPTION: This is the caption for the next figure link (or table)
   #+LABEL:   fig:SED-HR4049
   [[./img/a.jpg]]
#+end_example

You may also define additional attributes for the figure.  As this is
backend-specific, see the sections about the individual backends for
more information.

See [[Handling links][the discussion of image links]].

** Literal examples
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Source code examples with special formatting
   :END:
#+cindex: literal examples, markup rules
#+cindex: code line references, markup rules

You can include literal examples that should not be subjected to
markup.  Such examples will be typeset in monospace, so this is well
suited for source code and similar examples.
#+cindex: #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

#+begin_example
   ,#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   Some example from a text file.
   ,#+END_EXAMPLE
#+end_example

Note that such blocks may be /indented/ in order to align nicely with
indented text and in particular with plain list structure (see [[Plain
lists]]).  For simplicity when using small examples, you can also start
the example lines with a colon followed by a space.  There may also be
additional whitespace before the colon:

#+begin_example
   Here is an example
      : Some example from a text file.
#+end_example

#+cindex: formatting source code, markup rules

If the example is source code from a programming language, or any
other text that can be marked up by font-lock in Emacs, you can ask
for the example to look like the fontified Emacs buffer.[fn:102] This
is done with the {{{samp(src)}}} block, where you also need to specify
the name of the major mode that should be used to fontify the example,
see [[Easy templates]] for shortcuts to easily insert code blocks.[fn:103]

#+cindex: #+BEGIN_SRC

#+begin_example
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defun org-xor (a b)
        "Exclusive or."
        (if a (not b) b))
   #+END_SRC
#+end_example

Both in ~example~ and in ~src~ snippets, you can add a ~-n~ switch to
the end of the ~BEGIN~ line, to get the lines of the example numbered.
If you use a ~+n~ switch, the numbering from the previous numbered
snippet will be continued in the current one.  In literal examples, Org
will interpret strings like {{{samp((ref:name))}}} as labels, and use
them as targets for special hyperlinks like ~[[(name)]]~ (i.e., the
reference name enclosed in single parenthesis).  In HTML, hovering the
mouse over such a link will remote-highlight the corresponding code
line, which is kind of cool.

You can also add a ~-r~ switch which /removes/ the labels from the
source code.[fn:104] With the ~-n~ switch, links to these references
will be labeled by the line numbers from the code listing, otherwise
links will use the labels with no parentheses.  Here is an example:

#+begin_example
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n -r
   (save-excursion                  (ref:sc)
      (goto-char (point-min))       (ref:jump)
   #+END_SRC
   In line [[(sc)]] we remember the current position.  [[(jump)][Line (jump)]]
   jumps to point-min.
#+end_example

#+vindex: org-coderef-label-format

If the syntax for the label format conflicts with the language syntax,
use a ~-l~ switch to change the format, for example
{{{samp(#+BEGIN_SRC pascal -n -r -l "((%s))")}}}.  See also the
variable ~org-coderef-label-format~.

HTML export also allows examples to be published as text areas
(see [[Text areas in HTML export]]).

Because the ~#+BEGIN_...~ and ~#+END_...~ patterns need to be added so
often, shortcuts are provided using the Easy Templates facility (see
[[Easy templates]]).

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c ')}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c '

  Edit the source code example at point in its native mode.  This works
  by switching to a temporary buffer with the source code.  You need to
  exit by pressing {{{kbd(C-c ')}}} again.[fn:105] The edited version
  will then replace the old version in the Org buffer.  Fixed-width
  regions (where each line starts with a colon followed by a space) will
  be edited using ~artist-mode~ to allow creating ASCII drawings
  easily.[fn:106] Using this command in an empty line will create a new
  fixed-width region. 

- {{{kbd(C-c l)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c l

  Calling ~org-store-link~ while editing a source code example in a
  temporary buffer created with {{{kbd(C-c ')}}} will prompt for a
  label.  Make sure that it is unique in the current buffer, and insert
  it with the proper formatting like {{{samp((ref:label))}}} at the end
  of the current line.  Then the label is stored as a link
  {{{samp((label))}}}, for retrieval with {{{kbd(C-c C-l)}}}.

** Include files
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Include additional files into a document
   :END:
#+cindex: include files, markup rules

During export, you can include the content of another file.  For
example, to include your {{{file(.emacs)}}} file, you could use:

#+cindex: #+INCLUDE

#+begin_example
   ,#+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" src emacs-lisp
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} The optional second and third parameter are the markup
(e.g., {{{samp(quote)}}}, {{{samp(example)}}}, or {{{samp(src)}}}),
and, if the markup is {{{samp(src)}}}, the language for formatting the
contents.  The markup is optional; if it is not given, the text will be
assumed to be in Org mode format and will be processed normally.  The
include line will also allow additional keyword parameters ~:prefix1~
and ~:prefix~ to specify prefixes for the first line and for each
following line, ~:minlevel~ in order to get Org mode content demoted
to a specified level, as well as any options accepted by the selected
markup.  For example, to include a file as an item, use:

#+begin_example
   ,#+INCLUDE: "~/snippets/xx" :prefix1 "   + " :prefix "     "
#+end_example

You can also include a portion of a file by specifying a lines range
using the ~:lines~ parameter.  The line at the upper end of the range
will not be included.  The start and/or the end of the range may be
omitted to use the obvious defaults.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" :lines "5-10" ::  

  Include lines 5 to 10, 10 excluded.

- #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" :lines "-10"  ::  

  Include lines 1 to 10, 10 excluded.

- #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" :lines "10-"  ::  

  Include lines from 10 to EOF.


#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c ')}}}
  #+kindex: C-c '

  Visit the include file at point.

** Index entries
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Making an index
   :END:
#+cindex: index entries, for publishing

You can specify entries that will be used for generating an index
during publishing.  This is done by lines starting with ~#+INDEX~.  An
entry the contains an exclamation mark will create a sub item.  See
[[Generating an index]] for more information.

#+begin_example
   ,* Curriculum Vitae
   #+INDEX: CV
   #+INDEX: Application!CV
#+end_example

** Macro replacement
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Use macros to create complex output
   :END:
#+cindex: macro replacement, during export
#+cindex: #+MACRO

You can define text snippets with a macro:

#+begin_example
   ,#+MACRO: name   replacement text $1, $2 are arguments
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} which can be referenced anywhere in the document (even in
code examples) with ~{{{name(arg1,arg2)}}}~.  In addition to
defined macros, ~{{{title}}}~, ~{{{author}}}~, etc.,
will reference information set by the ~#+TITLE:~, ~#+AUTHOR:~, and
similar lines.  Also, ~{{{date(FORMAT)}}}~ and
~{{{modification-time(FORMAT)}}}~ refer to current date time
and to the modification time of the file being exported, respectively.
~FORMAT~ should be a format string understood by
~format-time-string~.

Macro expansion takes place during export, and some people use it to
construct complex HTML code.

** FIXME Embedded LaTeX
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: LaTeX can be freely used inside Org documents
   :ALT_TITLE: Embedded Latex
   :END:
#+cindex: @TeX{} interpretation
#+cindex: @LaTeX{} interpretation

Plain ASCII is normally sufficient for almost all note taking.
Exceptions include scientific notes, which often require mathematical
symbols and the occasional formula.  LaTeX is widely used to typeset
scientific documents.[fn:107] Org mode supports embedding LaTeX
code into its files, because many academics are used to writing and
reading LaTeX source code, and because it can be readily processed
to produce pretty output for a number of export backends.

*** Special symbols
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Greek letters and other symbols
    :END:
#+cindex: math symbols
#+cindex: special symbols
#+cindex: @TeX{} macros
#+cindex: @LaTeX{} fragments, markup rules
#+cindex: HTML entities
#+cindex: @LaTeX{} entities

You can use LaTeX macros to insert special symbols like
~\alpha~ to indicate the Greek letter, or ~\to~ to
indicate an arrow.  Completion for these macros is available, just type
~\~ and maybe a few letters, and press {{{kbdkey(M-,TAB)}}}
to see possible completions.  Unlike LaTeX code, Org mode allows
these macros to be present without surrounding math delimiters, for
example:

#+begin_example
   Angles are written as Greek letters \alpha, \beta and \gamma.
#+end_example

#+vindex: org-entities

During export, these symbols will be transformed into the native
format of the exporter backend.  Strings like ~\alpha~ will be exported
as ~&alpha;~ in the HTML output, and as ~$\alpha$~ in the LaTeX
output.  Similarly, ~\nbsp~ will become ~&nbsp;~ in HTML and ~~~ in
LaTeX.  If you need such a symbol inside a word, terminate it like
this: ~\Aacute{}stor~.

A large number of entities is provided, with names taken from both
HTML and LaTeX; see the variable ~org-entities~ for the complete
list.  ~\-~ is treated as a shy hyphen, and {{{samp(--)}}},
{{{samp(---)}}}, and {{{samp(...)}}} are all converted into special
commands creating hyphens of different lengths or a compact set of
dots.

If you would like to see entities displayed as UTF8 characters, use the
following command:[fn:108]

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-x XXX)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x XXX
# Should be \
  Toggle display of entities as UTF-8 characters.  This does not change
  the buffer content which remains plain ASCII, but it overlays the
  UTF-8 character for display purposes only.

*** FIXME Subscripts and superscripts
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Simple syntax for raising/lowering text
    :END:
#+cindex: subscript
#+cindex: superscript

Just like in LaTeX, {{{samp(^)}}} and {{{samp(_)}}} are used to
indicate super- and subscripts.  Again, these can be used without
embedding them in math-mode delimiters.  To increase the readability of
ASCII text, it is not necessary (but OK) to surround multi-character
sub- and superscripts with curly braces.  For example

#+begin_example
   The mass of the sun is M_sun = 1.989 x 10^30 kg.  The radius of
   the sun is R_{sun} = 6.96 x 10^8 m.
#+end_example

#+vindex: org-export-with-sub-superscripts

To avoid interpretation as raised or lowered text, you can quote
{{{kbd(^)}}} and {{{kbd(_)}}} with a backslash: ~\^~ and ~\_~.  If you
write a text where the underscore is often used in a different
context, Org's convention to always interpret these as subscripts can
get in your way.  Configure the variable
~org-export-with-sub-superscripts~ to globally change this convention,
or use, on a per-file basis:

#+begin_example
   ,#+OPTIONS: ^:{}
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} With this setting, ~a_b~ will not be interpreted as a
subscript, but ~a_{b}~ will.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-x XXX)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x XXX
# Should be \
  In addition to showing entities as UTF-8 characters, this command will
  also format sub- and superscripts in a WYSIWYM way.

*** LaTeX fragments
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Complex formulas made easy
    :END:
#+cindex: @LaTeX{} fragments
#+vindex: org-format-latex-header

Going beyond symbols and sub- and superscripts, a full formula
language is needed.  Org mode can contain LaTeX math fragments, and
it supports ways to process these for several export backends.  When
exporting to LaTeX, the code is obviously left as it is.  When
exporting to HTML, Org invokes the [[http://www.mathjax.org][MathJax library]] (see [[Math
formatting in HTML export]]) to process and display the math.[fn:109]
Finally, it can also process the mathematical expressions into images
that can be displayed in a browser or in DocBook documents.[fn:110]

LaTeX fragments don't need any special marking at all.  The following
snippets will be identified as LaTeX source code:

- Environments of any kind.[fn:111]  The only requirement is that the
  ~\begin~ statement appears on a new line, preceded by only whitespace.

- Text within the usual LaTeX math delimiters.  To avoid conflicts
  with currency specifications, single ~$~ characters are
  only recognized as math delimiters if the enclosed text contains at
  most two line breaks, is directly attached to the ~$~
  characters with no whitespace in between, and if the closing
  ~$~ is followed by whitespace, punctuation or a dash.  For
  the other delimiters, there is no such restriction, so when in
  doubt, use ~\(...\)~ as inline math delimiters.


{{{noindent}}} For example:

#+begin_example
   \begin{equation}                          % arbitrary environments,
   x=\sqrt{b}                                % even tables, figures
   \end{equation}                            % etc

   If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be
   either $$ a=+\sqrt{2} $$ or \[ a=-\sqrt{2} \].
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}}
#+vindex: org-format-latex-options

If you need any of the delimiter ASCII sequences for other purposes,
you can configure the option ~org-format-latex-options~ to deselect
the ones you do not wish to have interpreted by the LaTeX
converter.

#+vindex: org-export-with-LaTeX-fragments

LaTeX processing can be configured with the variable
~org-export-with-LaTeX-fragments~.  The default setting is ~t~ which
means {{{file(MathJax)}}} for HTML, and no processing for DocBook,
ASCII and LaTeX backends.  You can also set this variable on a
per-file basis using one of these lines:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- #+OPTIONS: LaTeX:t ::          

  Do the right thing automatically (MathJax).

- #+OPTIONS: LaTeX:dvipng ::    

  Force using dvipng images.

- #+OPTIONS: LaTeX:nil ::        

  Do not process LaTeX fragments at all

- #+OPTIONS: LaTeX:verbatim ::  

  Verbatim export, for jsMath or so.

*** Previewing LaTeX fragments
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: What will this snippet look like?
    :END:
#+cindex: @LaTeX{} fragments, preview

If you have {{{file(dvipng)}}} installed, LaTeX fragments can be
processed to produce preview images of the typeset expressions:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-l)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x C-l

  Produce a preview image of the LaTeX fragment at point and overlay
  it over the source code.  If there is no fragment at point, process all
  fragments in the current entry (between two headlines).  When called
  with a prefix argument, process the entire subtree.  When called with
  two prefix arguments, or when the cursor is before the first headline,
  process the entire buffer.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-c

  Remove the overlay preview images.


#+vindex: org-format-latex-options

You can customize the variable ~org-format-latex-options~ to influence
some aspects of the preview.  In particular, the ~:scale~ (and for HTML
export, ~:html-scale~) property can be used to adjust the size of the
preview images.

*** CDLaTeX mode
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Speed up entering of formulas
    :TITLE:    Using CDLaTeX to enter math
    :END:
#+cindex: CD@LaTeX{}

CDLaTeX mode is a minor mode that is normally used in combination
with a major LaTeX mode like AUCTeX in order to speed-up
insertion of environments and math templates.  Inside Org mode, you can
make use of some of the features of CDLaTeX mode.  You need to
install {{{file(cdlatex.el)}}} and {{{file(texmathp.el)}}} (the latter
comes also with AUCTeX) from
[[http://www.astro.uva.nl/~dominik/Tools/cdlatex]].  Don't use CDLaTeX
mode itself under Org mode, but use the light version
~org-cdlatex-mode~ that comes as part of Org mode.  Turn it on for the
current buffer with ~M-x org-cdlatex-mode~, or for all Org files with
this hook:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-org-cdlatex)
#+end_src

When this mode is enabled, the following features are present (for more
details see the documentation of CDLaTeX mode):

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c {)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c @{

  Insert an environment template.

- {{{key(TAB)}}} ::
  #+kindex: @key{TAB}

  Expand a template if the cursor is inside a LaTeX fragment.[fn:112]
  For example, {{{key(TAB)}}} will expand ~fr~ to ~\frac{}{}~ and
  position the cursor correctly inside the first brace.  Another
  {{{key(TAB)}}} will get you into the second brace.  Even outside
  fragments, {{{key(TAB)}}} will expand environment abbreviations at the
  beginning of a line.  For example, if you write {{{samp(equ)}}} at the
  beginning of a line and press {{{key(TAB)}}}, this abbreviation will
  be expanded to an ~equation~ environment.  To get a list of all
  abbreviations, type {{{kbd(M-x cdlatex-command-help)}}}.

- {{{kbd(_)}}} {{{kbd(^)}}} ::
  #+kindex: _
  #+kindex: ^
  #+vindex: cdlatex-simplify-sub-super-scripts

  Pressing {{{kbd(_)}}} and {{{kbd(^)}}} inside a LaTeX fragment will
  insert these characters together with a pair of braces.  If you use
  {{{key(TAB)}}} to move out of the braces, and if the braces surround
  only a single character or macro, they are removed again (depending on
  the variable ~cdlatex-simplify-sub-super-scripts~).

- {{{kbd(`)}}} ::
  #+kindex: `

  Pressing the backquote followed by a character inserts math macros,
  also outside LaTeX fragments.  If you wait more than 1.5 seconds
  after the backquote, a help window will pop up.

- {{{kbd(')}}} ::
  #+kindex: '

  Pressing the single-quote followed by another character modifies the
  symbol before point with an accent or a font.  If you wait more than
  1.5 seconds after the single-quote, a help window will pop up.
  Character modification will work only inside LaTeX fragments;
  outside the quote is normal.

* FIXME Exporting
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: Sharing and publishing notes
  :END:
#+cindex: exporting

Org mode documents can be exported into a variety of other formats.
For printing and sharing of notes, ASCII export produces a readable
and simple version of an Org file.  HTML export allows you to publish a
notes file on the web, while the XOXO format provides a solid base for
exchange with a broad range of other applications.  LaTeX export
lets you use Org mode and its structured editing functions to easily
create LaTeX files.  DocBook export makes it possible to convert Org
files to many other formats using DocBook tools.  OpenDocument Text
(ODT) export allows seamless collaboration across organizational
boundaries.  For project management you can create gantt and resource
charts by using TaskJuggler export.  To incorporate entries with
associated times like deadlines or appointments into a desktop
calendar program like iCal, Org mode can also produce extracts in the
iCalendar format.  Currently, Org mode only supports export, not import
of these different formats.

Org supports export of selected regions when ~transient-mark-mode~ is
enabled (default in Emacs 23).

** Selective export
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Using tags to select and exclude trees
   :END:
#+cindex: export, selective by tags or TODO keyword
#+vindex: org-export-select-tags
#+vindex: org-export-exclude-tags
#+cindex: org-export-with-tasks

You may use tags to select the parts of a document that should be exported,
or to exclude parts from export.  This behavior is governed by two variables:
~org-export-select-tags~ and ~org-export-exclude-tags~,
respectively defaulting to ~:export:~ and ~:noexport:~.

1. Org first checks if any of the /select/ tags is present in the
   buffer.  If yes, all trees that do not carry one of these tags will
   be excluded.  If a selected tree is a subtree, the heading hierarchy
   above it will also be selected for export, but not the text below
   those headings.

2. If none of the select tags is found, the whole buffer will be
   selected for export.

3. Finally, all subtrees that are marked by any of the /exclude/ tags
   will be removed from the export buffer.


The variable ~org-export-with-tasks~ can be configured to select which
kind of tasks should be included for export.  See the docstring of the
variable for more information.

** FIXME Export options
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Per-file export settings
   :END:
#+cindex: options, for export
#+cindex: completion, of option keywords

The exporter recognizes special lines in the buffer which provide
additional information.  These lines may be put anywhere in the file.
The whole set of lines can be inserted into the buffer with 
{{{kbd(C-c C-e t)}}}.  For individual lines, a good way to make sure the keyword
is correct is to type {{{samp(#+)}}} and then use {{{kbdkey(M-,TAB)}}}
completion (see [[Completion]]).  For a summary of other in-buffer settings
not specifically related to export, see [[In-buffer settings]].  In
particular, note that you can place commonly-used (export) options in
a separate file which can be included using ~#+SETUPFILE~.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-e t)}}}, ~org-insert-export-options-template~ ::

{{{noindent}}} These options take effect in both the HTML and LaTeX
export, except for ~TeX~ and ~LaTeX~ options, which are respectively
~t~ and ~nil~ for the LaTeX export.

The default values for these and many other options are given by a set
of variables.  For a list of such variables, the corresponding OPTIONS
keys and also the publishing keys (see [[Project alist]]), see the
constant ~org-export-plist-vars~.

When exporting only a single subtree by selecting it with
{{{kbd(C-c @)}}} before calling an export command, the subtree can
overrule some of the file's export settings with properties
~EXPORT_FILE_NAME~, ~EXPORT_TITLE~, ~EXPORT_TEXT~, ~EXPORT_AUTHOR~,
~EXPORT_DATE~, and ~EXPORT_OPTIONS~.

** The export dispatcher
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: How to access exporter commands
   :END:
#+cindex: dispatcher, for export commands

All export commands can be reached using the export dispatcher, which
is a prefix key that prompts for an additional key specifying the
command.  Normally the entire file is exported, but if there is an
active region that contains one outline tree, the first heading is
used as document title and the subtrees are exported.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-e)}}}, ~org-export~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e
  #+vindex: org-export-run-in-background

  Dispatcher for export and publishing commands.  Displays a help-window
  listing the additional key(s) needed to launch an export or publishing
  command.  The prefix arg is passed through to the exporter.  A double
  prefix {{{kbd(C-u C-u)}}} causes most commands to be executed in the
  background, in a separate Emacs process.[fn:115]

- {{{kbd(C-c C-e v)}}}, ~org-export-visible~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e v

  Like {{{kbd(C-c C-e)}}}, but only export the text that is currently visible
  (i.e., not hidden by outline visibility).

- {{{kbd(C-u C-u C-c C-e)}}}, ~org-export~ ::
  #+kindex: C-u C-u C-c C-e
  #+vindex: org-export-run-in-background

  Call the exporter, but reverse the setting of
  ~org-export-run-in-background~, i.e., request background processing if
  not set, or force processing in the current Emacs process if set.

** ASCII/Latin-1/UTF-8 export
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Exporting to flat files with encoding
   :END:
#+cindex: ASCII export
#+cindex: Latin-1 export
#+cindex: UTF-8 export

ASCII export produces a simple and very readable version of an Org
mode file, containing only plain ASCII.  Latin-1 and UTF-8 export
augment the file with special characters and symbols available in
these encodings.

#+cindex: region, active
#+cindex: active region
#+cindex: transient-mark-mode

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-e a)}}}, ~org-export-as-ascii~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e a
  #+cindex: property, EXPORT_FILE_NAME

  Export as an ASCII file.  For an Org file, {{{file(myfile.org)}}}, the
  ASCII file will be {{{file(myfile.txt)}}}.  The file will be
  overwritten without warning.  If there is an active region, only the
  region will be exported.[fn:116] If the selected region is a single
  tree, the tree head will become the document title.[fn:117] If the
  tree head entry has or inherits an ~EXPORT_FILE_NAME~ property, that
  name will be used for the export.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-e A)}}}, ~org-export-as-ascii-to-buffer~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e A

  Export to a temporary buffer.  Do not create a file.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-e n)}}}, ~org-export-as-latin1~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e n

  Like {{{kbd(C-c C-e a)}}}, but use Latin-1 encoding.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-e N)}}}, ~org-export-as-latin1-to-buffer~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e N

  Like {{{kbd(C-c C-e A)}}}, but use Latin-1 encoding.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-e u)}}}, ~org-export-as-utf8~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e u

  Like {{{kbd(C-c C-e a)}}}, but use UTF-8 encoding.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-e U)}}}, ~org-export-as-utf8-to-buffer~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e U

  Like {{{kbd(C-c C-e A)}}}, but use UTF-8 encoding.


- {{{kbd(C-c C-e v a/n/u)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e v a
  #+kindex: C-c C-e v n
  #+kindex: C-c C-e v u

  Export only the visible part of the document.


#+cindex: headline levels, for exporting

In the exported version, the first 3 outline levels will become
headlines, defining a general document structure.  Additional levels
will be exported as itemized lists.  If you want that transition to
occur at a different level, specify it with a prefix argument, e.g.:

#+begin_example
   C-1 C-c C-e a
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} This setting creates only top level headlines and
exports the rest as items.  When headlines are converted to items, the
indentation of the text following the headline is changed to fit
nicely under the item.  This is done with the assumption that the first
body line indicates the base indentation of the body text.  Any
indentation larger than this is adjusted to preserve the layout
relative to the first line.  Should there be lines with less
indentation than the first one, these are left alone.

#+vindex: org-export-ascii-links-to-notes

Links will be exported in a footnote-like style, with the descriptive
part in the text and the link in a note before the next heading.  See
the variable ~org-export-ascii-links-to-notes~ for details and other
options.

** HTML export
   :PROPERTIES:

Org mode contains a HTML (XHTML 1.0 strict) exporter with extensive
HTML formatting, in ways similar to John Gruber's /markdown/ language,
but with additional support for tables.

*** HTML export commands

- {{{kbd(C-c C-e h)}}}, ~org-export-as-html~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e h
  #+cindex: property, EXPORT_FILE_NAME

  Export as an HTML file.  For an Org file {{{file(myfile.org)}}}, the
  HTML file will be {{{file(myfile.html)}}}.  The file will be
  overwritten without warning.  If there is an active region, only the
  active region will be exported.[fn:118] If the selected region is a
  single tree, the tree head will become the document title.[fn:119] If
  the tree head entry has, or inherits, an ~EXPORT_FILE_NAME~ property,
  that name will be used for the export.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-e b)}}}, ~org-export-as-html-and-open~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e b

  Export as a HTML file and immediately open it with a browser.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-e H)}}}, ~org-export-as-html-to-buffer~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e H

  Export to a temporary buffer.  Do not create a file.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-e R)}}}, ~org-export-region-as-html~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e R

  Export the active region to a temporary buffer.  With a prefix
  argument, do not produce the file header and footer, but just the
  plain HTML section for the region.  This is good for cut-and-paste
  operations.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-e v h/b/H/R)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e v h
  #+kindex: C-c C-e v b
  #+kindex: C-c C-e v H
  #+kindex: C-c C-e v R

  Export only the visible part of the document.

- {{{kbd(M-x org-export-region-as-html)}}} ::

  Convert the region to HTML under the assumption that it was in Org
  mode syntax before.  This is a global command that can be invoked in
  any buffer.

- {{{kbd(M-x org-replace-region-by-HTML)}}} ::

  Replace the active region (assumed to be in Org mode syntax) by HTML
  code.


#+cindex: headline levels, for exporting

In the exported version, the first three outline levels will become
headlines, defining a general document structure.  Additional levels
will be exported as itemized lists.  If you want that transition to
occur at a different level, specify it with a numeric prefix argument,
e.g.:

#+begin_example
   C-2 C-c C-e b
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} This setting creates two levels of headings and exports
the rest as list items.

*** HTML preamble and postamble
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How to insert a preamble and postamble
    :END:
#+vindex: org-export-html-preamble
#+vindex: org-export-html-postamble
#+vindex: org-export-html-preamble-format

#+vindex: org-export-author-info
#+vindex: org-export-email-info
#+vindex: org-export-creator-info
#+vindex: org-export-time-stamp-file

The HTML exporter lets you define a preamble and a postamble.

The default value for ~org-export-html-preamble~ is ~t~, which means
that the preamble is inserted depending on the relevant format string
in ~org-export-html-preamble-format~.

Setting ~org-export-html-preamble~ to a string will override the default
format string.  Setting it to a function, will insert the output of the
function, which must be a string; such a function takes no argument but you
can check against the value of ~opt-plist~, which contains the list of
publishing properties for the current file.  Setting to ~nil~ will not
insert any preamble.

The default value for ~org-export-html-postamble~ is
{{{samp('auto)}}}, which means that the HTML exporter will look for
the value of ~org-export-author-info~, ~org-export-email-info~,
~org-export-creator-info~ and ~org-export-time-stamp-file~,
~org-export-html-validation-link~ and build the postamble from these
values.  Setting ~org-export-html-postamble~ to ~t~ will insert the
postamble from the relevant format string found in
~org-export-html-postamble-format~.  Setting it to ~nil~ will not
insert any postamble.

*** Quoting HTML tags
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Using direct HTML in Org mode
    :END:

Plain ~<~ and {{{samp(>)}}} are always transformed to
{{{samp(&lt;)}}} and {{{samp(&gt;)}}} in HTML export.  If you want to
include simple HTML tags which should be interpreted as such, mark
them with {{{samp(@)}}} as in {{{samp(@<b>bold text@</b>)}}}.  Note
that this really works only for simple tags.  For more extensive HTML
that should be copied verbatim to the exported file use either ~#+HTML~:

#+cindex: #+HTML
#+cindex: #+BEGIN_HTML
#+begin_example
   ,#+HTML: Literal HTML code for export
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} or an HTML block:
#+cindex: #+BEGIN_HTML

#+begin_example
   #+BEGIN_HTML
   All lines between these markers are exported literally
   #+END_HTML
#+end_example

*** Links in HTML export
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How links will be interpreted and formatted
    :END:
#+cindex: links, in HTML export
#+cindex: internal links, in HTML export
#+cindex: external links, in HTML export

Internal links (see [[Internal links]]) will continue to work in HTML.
This includes automatic links created by radio targets (see [[Radio
targets]]).  Links to external files will still work if the target file
is on the same /relative/ path as the published Org file.  Links to
other {{{file(.org)}}} files will be translated into HTML links under
the assumption that a HTML version also exists of the linked file, at
the same relative path.  ~id:~ links can then be used to jump
to specific entries across files.  For information related to linking
files while publishing them to a publishing directory see [[Publishing
links]].

If you want to specify attributes for links, you can do so using a
special ~#+ATTR_HTML~ line to define attributes that will be added to
the ~<a>~ or ~<img>~ tags.  Here is an example that sets ~title~ and
~style~ attributes for a link:

#+cindex: #+ATTR_HTML
#+begin_example
   ,#+ATTR_HTML: title="The Org mode homepage" style="color:red;"
   ,[[https://orgmode.org]]
#+end_example

*** Tables in HTML export
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How to modify the formatting of tables
    :END:
#+cindex: tables, in HTML
#+vindex: org-export-html-table-tag

Org mode tables are exported to HTML using the table tag defined in
~org-export-html-table-tag~.  The default setting makes tables without
cell borders and frame.  If you would like to change this for
individual tables, place something like the following before the
table:

#+cindex: #+CAPTION
#+cindex: #+ATTR_HTML
#+begin_example
   ,#+CAPTION: This is a table with lines around and between cells
   ,#+ATTR_HTML: border="2" rules="all" frame="border"
#+end_example

*** Images in HTML export
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How to insert figures into HTML output
    :END:
#+cindex: images, inline in HTML
#+cindex: inlining images in HTML
#+vindex: org-export-html-inline-images

HTML export can inline images given as links in the Org file, and it
can make an image the clickable part of a link.  By default, images are
inlined if a link does not have a description.[fn:120] So
~[[file:myimg.jpg]]~ will be inlined, while ~[[file:myimg.jpg][the
image]]~ will just produce a link {{{samp(the image)}}} that points to
the image.  If the description part itself is a ~file:~ link or
a ~http:~ URL pointing to an image, this image will be inlined and
activated so that clicking on the image will activate the link.  For
example, to include a thumbnail that will link to a high resolution
version of the image, you could use:

#+begin_example
   [[file:highres.jpg][file:thumb.jpg]]
#+end_example

If you need to add attributes to an inlined image, use a ~#+ATTR_HTML~.
In the example below we specify the ~alt~ and ~title~ attributes to
support text viewers and accessibility, and align it to the right.

#+cindex: #+CAPTION
#+cindex: #+ATTR_HTML
#+begin_example
   ,#+CAPTION: A black cat stalking a spider
   ,#+ATTR_HTML: alt="cat/spider image" title="Action!" align="right"
   [[./img/a.jpg]]
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} You could use ~http~ addresses just as well.

*** Math formatting in HTML export
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Beautiful math also on the web
    :END:
#+cindex: MathJax
#+cindex: dvipng

LaTeX math snippets (see [[LaTeX fragments]]) can be displayed in two
different ways on HTML pages.  The default is to use the [[http://www.mathjax.org][MathJax system]]
which should work out of the box with Org mode installation because
~https://orgmode.org~ serves {{{file(MathJax)}}} for Org mode users for
small applications and for testing purposes.[fn:121] To configure
{{{file(MathJax)}}}, use the variable
~org-export-html-mathjax-options~ or insert something like the
following into the buffer:

#+begin_example
   ,#+MATHJAX: align:"left" mathml:t path:"/MathJax/MathJax.js"
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} See the docstring of the variable
~org-export-html-mathjax-options~ for the meaning of the parameters in
this line.

If you prefer, you can also request that LaTeX fragments are
processed into small images that will be inserted into the browser
page.  Before the availability of MathJax, this was the default method
for Org files.  This method requires that the {{{file(dvipng)}}}
program is available on your system.  You can still get this processing
with the following option:

#+begin_example
   ,#+OPTIONS: LaTeX:dvipng
#+end_example

*** Text areas in HTML export
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: An alternate way to show an example
    :END:
#+cindex: text areas, in HTML

An alternative way to publish literal code examples in HTML is to use
text areas, where the example can even be edited before pasting it
into an application.  It is triggered by a ~-t~ switch at an ~example~
or ~src~ block.  Using this switch disables any options for syntax and
label highlighting, and line numbering, which may be present.  You may
also use ~-h~ and ~-w~ switches to specify the height and width of the
text area, which default to the number of lines in the example, and
80, respectively.  For example

#+begin_example
   ,#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE -t -w 40
     (defun org-xor (a b)
        "Exclusive or."
        (if a (not b) b))
   ,#+END_EXAMPLE
#+end_example

*** CSS support

#+cindex: CSS, for HTML export
#+cindex: HTML export, CSS
#+vindex: org-export-html-todo-kwd-class-prefix
#+vindex: org-export-html-tag-class-prefix

You can also give style information for the exported file.  The HTML
exporter assigns the following special CSS classes to appropriate
parts of the document---your style specifications may change these, in
addition to any of the standard classes like for headlines, tables,
etc.[fn:122]

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @code
- p.author ::           author information, including email
- p.date ::             publishing date
- p.creator ::           creator info, about org mode version
- .title ::             document title
- .todo ::              TODO keywords, all not-done states
- .done ::              the DONE keywords, all states that count as done
- .WAITING ::           each TODO keyword also uses a class named after itself
- .timestamp ::         timestamp
- .timestamp-kwd ::     keyword associated with a timestamp, like SCHEDULED
- .timestamp-wrapper ::  span around keyword plus timestamp
- .tag ::               tag in a headline
- ._HOME ::             each tag uses itself as a class, "@" replaced by "_"
- .target ::            target for links
- .linenr ::            the line number in a code example
- .code-highlighted ::  for highlighting referenced code lines
- div.outline-N ::      div for outline level N (headline plus text))
- div.outline-text-N :: extra div for text at outline level N
- .section-number-N ::  section number in headlines, different for each level
- div.figure ::         how to format an inlined image
- pre.src ::            formatted source code
- pre.example ::         normal example
- p.verse ::            verse paragraph
- div.footnotes ::      footnote section headline
- p.footnote ::         footnote definition paragraph, containing a footnote
- .footref ::           a footnote reference number (always a <sup>)
- .footnum ::           footnote number in footnote definition (always <sup>)


#+vindex: org-export-html-style-default
#+vindex: org-export-html-style-include-default
#+vindex: org-export-html-style
#+vindex: org-export-html-extra
#+vindex: org-export-html-style-default

Each exported file contains a compact default style that defines these
classes in a basic way.[fn:123]  You may overwrite these
settings, or add to them by using the variables ~org-export-html-style~
(for Org-wide settings) and ~org-export-html-style-extra~ (for more
fine-grained settings, like file-local settings).  To set the latter variable
individually for each file, you can use a ~#+STYLE:~ line:

#+cindex: #+STYLE
#+begin_example
   ,#+STYLE: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="stylesheet.css" />
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} For longer style definitions, you can use several such
lines.  You could also directly write a ~<style>~ ~</style>~ section in
this way, without referring to an external file.

In order to add styles to a subtree, use the ~:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS:~
property to assign a class to the tree.  In order to specify CSS styles
for a particular headline, you can use the id specified in a
~:CUSTOM_ID:~ property.

*** JavaScript support
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Info and folding in a web browser
    :END:
#+cindex: Rose, Sebastian

Sebastian Rose has written a JavaScript program especially designed to
enhance the web viewing experience of HTML files created with Org.  This
program allows you to view large files in two different ways.  The first one
is an /Info/-like mode where each section is displayed separately and
navigation can be done with the {{{kbd(n)}}} and {{{kbd(p)}}} keys (and some other keys
as well, press {{{kbd(?)}}} for an overview of the available keys).  The second
view type is a /folding/ view much like Org provides inside Emacs.  The
script is available at [[https://orgmode.org/org-info.js]] and you can find
the documentation for it at [[https://orgmode.org/worg/code/org-info-js/]].
We host the script at our site, but if you use it a lot, you might
not want to be dependent on ~orgmode.org~ and prefer to install a local
copy on your own web server.

To use the script, you need to make sure that the
{{{file(org-jsinfo.el)}}} module gets loaded.  It should be loaded by
default, but you can try {{{ksksksk(M-x customize-variable,RET,org-modules,RET)}}} 
to convince yourself that this is indeed the case.  All it then takes to make use of the program
is adding a single line to the Org file:

#+cindex: #+INFOJS_OPT
#+begin_example
   ,#+INFOJS_OPT: view:info toc:nil
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} If this line is found, the HTML header will
automatically contain the code needed to invoke the script.  Using the
line above, you can set the following viewing options:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @code
- path: ::   

  The path to the script.  The default is to grab the script from
  [[https://orgmode.org/org-info.js]], but you might want to have
  a local copy and use a path like {{{samp(../scripts/org-info.js)}}}.

- view: ::   

  Initial view when the website is first shown.  Possible values are:
  
  - info ::     Info-like interface with one section per page.
  - overview :: Folding interface, initially showing only top-level.
  - content ::  Folding interface, starting with all headlines visible.
  - showall ::  Folding interface, all headlines and text visible.

- sdepth: :: 

  Maximum headline level that will still become an independent section
  for info and folding modes.  The default is taken from
  ~org-export-headline-levels~ (= the ~H~ switch in ~#+OPTIONS~).  If
  this is smaller than in ~org-export-headline-levels~, each
  info/folding section can still contain child headlines.

- toc: ::    

  Should the table of contents /initially/ be visible? Even when ~nil~,
  you can always get to the "toc" with {{{kbd(i)}}}.

- tdepth: :: 

  The depth of the table of contents.  The defaults are taken from the
  variables ~org-export-headline-levels~ and ~org-export-with-toc~.

- ftoc: ::   

  Does the CSS of the page specify a fixed position for the "toc"? If
  yes, the toc will never be displayed as a section.

- ltoc: ::   

  Should there be short contents (children) in each section? Make this
  ~above~ if the section should be above initial text.

- mouse: ::  

  Headings are highlighted when the mouse is over them.  Should be
  {{{samp(underline)}}} (default) or a background color like
  {{{samp(#cccccc)}}}.

- buttons: :: 

  Should view-toggle buttons be everywhere? When ~nil~ (the default),
  only one such button will be present.


#+vindex: org-infojs-options
#+vindex: org-export-html-use-infojs

{{{noindent}}} You can choose default values for these options by
customizing the variable ~org-infojs-options~.  If you always want to
apply the script to your pages, configure the variable
~org-export-html-use-infojs~.

** LaTeX and PDF export
   :PROPERTIES:

#+cindex: @LaTeX{} export
#+cindex: PDF export
#+cindex: Guerry, Bastien

Org mode contains a LaTeX exporter written by Bastien Guerry.  With
further processing, this backend is also used to produce PDF
output.[fn:124] Since the LaTeX output uses {{{file(hyperref)}}} to
implement links and cross references, the PDF output file will be
fully linked.  Beware of the fact that your ~org~ file has to be
properly structured in order to be correctly exported: respect the
hierarchy of sections.

#+cindex: headline levels, for exporting
#+vindex: org-latex-low-levels

In the exported version, the first 3 outline levels will become
headlines, defining a general document structure.  Additional levels
will be exported as description lists.  The exporter can ignore them or
convert them to a custom string depending on ~org-latex-low-levels~.

If you want that transition to occur at a different level, specify it
with a numeric prefix argument, e.g.:

#+begin_example
   C-2 C-c C-e l
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} The example setting creates two levels of headings and
exports the rest as list items.

*** Header and sectioning
    :PROPERTIES:

#+cindex: @LaTeX{} sectioning structure
#+cindex: @LaTeX{} header
#+cindex: header, for @LaTeX{} files
#+cindex: sectioning structure, for @LaTeX{} export

By default, the LaTeX output uses the class ~article~.

#+cindex: property, LaTeX_CLASS
#+cindex: property, LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS

You can change this globally by setting a different value for
~org-export-latex-default-class~ or locally by adding an option like
~#+LaTeX_CLASS: myclass~ in your file, or with a ~:LaTeX_CLASS:~
property that applies when exporting a region containing only this
(sub)tree.  The class must be listed in ~org-export-latex-classes~.
This variable defines a header template for each class, and allows you
to define the sectioning structure for each class.[fn:127] You can
also define your own classes there.  ~#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS~ or a
~:LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS:~ property can specify the options for the
~\documentclass~ macro.  The options to documentclass have to be
provided, as expected by LaTeX, within square brackets.  You can
also use ~#+LaTeX_HEADER: \usepackage{xyz}~ to add lines to the
header.  See the docstring of ~org-export-latex-classes~ for more
information.  An example is shown below.

#+begin_example
   ,#+LaTeX_CLASS: article
   ,#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [a4paper]

*** Quoting LaTeX code
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Incorporating literal LaTeX code
    :END:

Embedded LaTeX as described in [[Embedded LaTeX]], will be correctly
inserted into the LaTeX file.  This includes simple macros like
~\ref{LABEL}~ to create a cross reference to a figure.  Furthermore,
you can add special code that should only be present in LaTeX export
with the following constructs:

#+cindex: #+LaTeX
#+cindex: #+BEGIN_LaTeX
#+begin_example
   ,#+LaTeX: Literal LaTeX code for export
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} or

#+cindex: #+BEGIN_LaTeX

   All lines between these markers are exported literally
   ,#+END_LaTeX
#+end_example

*** Tables in LaTeX export
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Options for exporting tables to LaTeX
    :END:
#+cindex: tables, in @LaTeX{} export

For LaTeX export of a table, you can specify a label, a caption and
placement options (see [[Images and tables]]).  You can also use the
~ATTR_LaTeX~ line to request a ~longtable~ environment for the
table, so that it may span several pages, or to change the default table
environment from ~table~ to ~table*~ or to change the default inner
tabular environment to ~tabularx~ or ~tabulary~.  Finally, you can
set the alignment string, and (with ~tabularx~ or ~tabulary~) the
width:

#+cindex: #+CAPTION
#+cindex: #+LABEL
#+cindex: #+ATTR_LaTeX
#+begin_example
   ,#+CAPTION: A long table
   ,#+LABEL: tbl:long
   ,#+ATTR_LaTeX: longtable align=l|lp@{3cm@}r|l
   | ..... | ..... |
   | ..... | ..... |
#+end_example

or to specify a multicolumn table with ~tabulary~:

#+cindex: #+CAPTION
#+cindex: #+LABEL
#+cindex: #+ATTR_LaTeX
#+begin_example
   ,#+CAPTION: A wide table with tabulary
   ,#+LABEL: tbl:wide
   ,#+ATTR_LaTeX: table* tabulary width=\textwidth
   | ..... | ..... |
   | ..... | ..... |
#+end_example

*** Images in LaTeX export
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How to insert figures into LaTeX output
    :END:
#+cindex: images, inline in LaTeX
#+cindex: inlining images in LaTeX

Images that are linked to without a description part in the link, like
~[[file:img.jpg]]~ or ~[[./img.jpg]]~ will be inserted into the PDF
output file resulting from LaTeX processing.  Org will use an
~\includegraphics~ macro to insert the image.  If you have specified
a caption and/or a label as described in [[Images and tables]], the
figure will be wrapped into a ~figure~ environment and thus become
a floating element.  You can use an ~#+ATTR_LaTeX:~ line to specify
various other options.  You can ask org to export an image as a float
without specifying a label or a caption by using the keyword ~float~
in this line.  Various optional arguments to the ~\includegraphics~
macro can also be specified in this fashion.  To modify the placement
option of the floating environment, add something like
{{{samp(placement=[h!])}}} to the attributes.  It is to be noted this
option can be used with tables as well.[fn:128]

If you would like to let text flow around the image, add the word
{{{samp(wrap)}}} to the ~#+ATTR_LaTeX:~ line, which will make the
figure occupy the left half of the page.  To fine-tune, the ~placement~
field will be the set of additional arguments needed by the
~wrapfigure~ environment.  Note that if you change the size of the
image, you need to use compatible settings for ~\includegraphics~ and
~wrapfigure~.

#+cindex: #+CAPTION
#+cindex: #+LABEL
#+cindex: #+ATTR_LaTeX
#+begin_example
   ,#+CAPTION:    The black-body emission of the disk around HR 4049
   ,#+LABEL:      fig:SED-HR4049
   ,#+ATTR_LaTeX: width=5cm,angle=90
   [[./img/sed-hr4049.pdf]]

   ,#+ATTR_LaTeX: width=0.38\textwidth wrap placement=@{r@}@{0.4\textwidth@}
   [[./img/hst.png]]
#+end_example

If you wish to include an image which spans multiple columns in a page, you
can use the keyword ~multicolumn~ in the ~#+ATTR_LaTeX~ line.  This
will export the image wrapped in a ~figure*~ environment.

If you need references to a label created in this way, write
~\ref{fig:SED-HR4049}~ just like in LaTeX.

*** Beamer class export
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Turning the file into a presentation
    :END:

The LaTeX class {{{file(beamer)}}} allows production of high
quality presentations using LaTeX and pdf processing.  Org mode has
special support for turning an Org mode file or tree into a
{{{file(beamer)}}} presentation.

When the LaTeX class for the current buffer (as set with ~#+LaTeX_CLASS:
beamer~) or subtree (set with a ~LaTeX_CLASS~ property) is
~beamer~, a special export mode will turn the file or tree into a beamer
presentation.  Any tree with not-too-deep level nesting should in principle be
exportable as a beamer presentation.  By default, the top-level entries (or
the first level below the selected subtree heading) will be turned into
frames, and the outline structure below this level will become itemize lists.
You can also configure the variable ~org-beamer-frame-level~ to a
different level---then the hierarchy above frames will produce the sectioning
structure of the presentation.

A template for useful in-buffer settings or properties can be inserted
into the buffer with 
{{{kbd(M-x org-insert-beamer-options-template)}}}.  Among other things, this will
install a column view format which is very handy for editing special
properties used by beamer.

You can influence the structure of the presentation using the following
properties:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~BEAMER_env~ ::

  The environment that should be used to format this entry.  Valid
  environments are defined in the constant
  ~org-beamer-environments-default~, and you can define more in
  ~org-beamer-environments-extra~.  If this property is set, the entry
  will also get a ~:B_environment:~ tag to make this visible.  This tag
  has no semantic meaning, it is only a visual aid.

- ~BEAMER_envargs~ ::

  The beamer-special arguments that should be used for the environment,
  like ~[t]~ or ~[<+->]~ of ~<2-3>~.  If the ~BEAMER_col~ property is
  also set, something like ~C[t]~ can be added here as well to set an
  options argument for the implied ~columns~ environment.  ~c[t]~ or
  ~c<2->~ will set an options for the implied ~column~ environment.

- ~BEAMER_col~ ::

  The width of a column that should start with this entry.  If this
  property is set, the entry will also get a ~:BMCOL:~ property to make
  this visible.  Also this tag is only a visual aid.  When this is a plain
  number, it will be interpreted as a fraction of ~\textwidth~.
  Otherwise it will be assumed that you have specified the units, like
  {{{samp(3cm)}}}.  The first such property in a frame will start a
  ~columns~ environment to surround the columns.  This environment is
  closed when an entry has a ~BEAMER_col~ property with value 0 or 1, or
  automatically at the end of the frame.

- ~BEAMER_extra~ ::

  Additional commands that should be inserted after the environment has
  been opened.  For example, when creating a frame, this can be used to
  specify transitions.


Frames will automatically receive a ~fragile~ option if they contain
source code that uses the verbatim environment.  Special {{{file(beamer)}}}
specific code can be inserted using ~#+BEAMER:~ and
~#+BEGIN_BEAMER~ ...  ~#+END_BEAMER~ constructs, similar to other export
backends, but with the difference that ~#+LaTeX:~ stuff will be included
in the presentation as well.

Outline nodes with ~BEAMER_env~ property value {{{samp(note)}}} or
{{{samp(noteNH)}}} will be formatted as beamer notes, i,e, they will be wrapped
into ~\note{...}~.  The former will include the heading as part of the
note text, the latter will ignore the heading of that node.  To simplify note
generation, it is actually enough to mark the note with a /tag/ (either
~:B_note:~ or ~:B_noteNH:~) instead of creating the
~BEAMER_env~ property.

You can turn on a special minor mode ~org-beamer-mode~ for editing
support with the following line:

#+begin_example
   ,#+STARTUP: beamer
#+end_example

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-b)}}}, ~org-beamer-select-environment~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-b

  In ~org-beamer-mode~, this key offers fast selection of a beamer
  environment or the ~BEAMER_col~ property.


Column view provides a great way to set the environment of a node and
other important parameters.  Make sure you are using a COLUMN format
that is geared toward this special purpose.  The command 
{{{kbd(M-x org-insert-beamer-options-template)}}} defines such a format.

Here is a simple example Org document that is intended for beamer export.

** DocBook export
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Exporting to DocBook
   :END:
#+cindex: DocBook export
#+cindex: PDF export
#+cindex: Cui, Baoqiu

Org contains a DocBook exporter written by Baoqiu Cui.  Once an Org file is
exported to DocBook format, it can be further processed to produce other
formats, including PDF, HTML, man pages, etc., using many available DocBook
tools and stylesheets.

Currently DocBook exporter only supports DocBook V5.0.

*** DocBook export commands
    :PROPERTIES:

- {{{kbd(C-c C-e D)}}}, ~org-export-as-docbook~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e D
  #+cindex: property EXPORT_FILE_NAME

  Export as a DocBook file.  For an Org file, {{{file(myfile.org)}}}, the
  DocBook XML file will be {{{file(myfile.xml)}}}.  The file will be
  overwritten without warning.  If there is an active region, only the
  region will be exported.[fn:129] If the selected region is a single
  tree, the tree head will become the document title.[fn:130] If the
  tree head entry has, or inherits, an ~EXPORT_FILE_NAME~ property, that
  name will be used for the export.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-e V)}}}, ~org-export-as-docbook-pdf-and-open~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e V

  Export as a DocBook file, process to PDF, then open the resulting PDF
  file.

  #+vindex: org-export-docbook-xslt-proc-command
  #+vindex: org-export-docbook-xsl-fo-proc-command

  Note that, in order to produce PDF output based on an exported DocBook
  file, you need to have XSLT processor and XSL-FO processor software
  installed on your system.  Check variables
  ~org-export-docbook-xslt-proc-command~ and
  ~org-export-docbook-xsl-fo-proc-command~.

  #+vindex: org-export-docbook-xslt-stylesheet

  The stylesheet argument ~%s~ in variable
  ~org-export-docbook-xslt-proc-command~ is replaced by the value of
  variable ~org-export-docbook-xslt-stylesheet~, which needs to be set by
  the user.  You can also overrule this global setting on a per-file basis by
  adding an in-buffer setting ~#+XSLT:~ to the Org file.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-e v D)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e v D

  Export only the visible part of the document.

*** Quoting DocBook code
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Incorporating DocBook code in Org files
    :END:
You can quote DocBook code in Org files and copy it verbatim into exported
DocBook file with the following constructs:

#+cindex: #+DOCBOOK
#+cindex: #+BEGIN_DOCBOOK
#+begin_example
   ,#+DOCBOOK: Literal DocBook code for export
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} or
#+cindex: #+BEGIN_DOCBOOK

#+begin_example
   ,#+BEGIN_DOCBOOK
   All lines between these markers are exported by DocBook exporter
   literally.
   ,#+END_DOCBOOK
#+end_example

For example, you can use the following lines to include a DocBook warning
admonition.  As to what this warning says, you should pay attention to the
document context when quoting DocBook code in Org files.  You may make
exported DocBook XML files invalid by not quoting DocBook code correctly.

#+begin_example
   ,#+BEGIN_DOCBOOK
   <warning>
     <para>You should know what you are doing when quoting DocBook XML code
     in your Org file.  Invalid DocBook XML may be generated by
     DocBook exporter if you are not careful!</para>
   </warning>
   ,#+END_DOCBOOK
#+end_example

*** Recursive sections
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Recursive sections in DocBook
    :END:
#+cindex: DocBook recursive sections

DocBook exporter exports Org files as articles using the ~article~
element in DocBook.  Recursive sections, i.e., ~section~ elements, are
used in exported articles.  Top level headlines in Org files are
exported as top level sections, and lower level headlines are exported
as nested sections.  The entire structure of Org files will be exported
completely, no matter how many nested levels of headlines there are.

Using recursive sections makes it easy to port and reuse exported
DocBook code in other DocBook document types like ~book~ or ~set~.

*** Tables in DocBook export
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Tables are exported as HTML tables
    :END:
#+cindex: tables, in DocBook export

Tables in Org files are exported as HTML tables, which have been
supported since DocBook V4.3.

If a table does not have a caption, an informal table is generated
using the ~informaltable~ element; otherwise, a formal table will be
generated using the ~table~ element.

*** Images in DocBook export
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How to insert figures into DocBook output
    :END:
#+cindex: images, inline in DocBook
#+cindex: inlining images in DocBook

Images that are linked to without a description part in the link, like
~[[file:img.jpg]]~ or ~[[./img.jpg]]~, will be exported to
DocBook using ~mediaobject~ elements.  Each ~mediaobject~ element
contains an ~imageobject~ that wraps an ~imagedata~ element.  If you
have specified a caption for an image as described in [[Images and
tables]], a ~caption~ element will be added in ~mediaobject~.  If a label
is also specified, it will be exported as an ~xml:id~ attribute of the
~mediaobject~ element.

#+vindex: org-export-docbook-default-image-attributes

Image attributes supported by the ~imagedata~ element, like ~align~ or
~width~, can be specified in two ways: you can either customize
variable ~org-export-docbook-default-image-attributes~ or use the
~#+ATTR_DOCBOOK:~ line.  Attributes specified in variable
~org-export-docbook-default-image-attributes~ are applied to all
inline images in the Org file to be exported (unless they are
overridden by image attributes specified in ~#+ATTR_DOCBOOK:~ lines).

The ~#+ATTR_DOCBOOK:~ line can be used to specify additional image
attributes or override default image attributes for individual images.
If the same attribute appears in both the ~#+ATTR_DOCBOOK:~ line and
variable ~org-export-docbook-default-image-attributes~, the former
takes precedence.  Here is an example about how image attributes can be
set:

#+cindex: #+CAPTION
#+cindex: #+LABEL
#+cindex: #+ATTR_DOCBOOK
#+begin_example
   ,#+CAPTION:    The logo of Org mode
   ,#+LABEL:      unicorn-svg
   ,#+ATTR_DOCBOOK: scalefit="1" width="100%" depth="100%"
   [[./img/org-mode-unicorn.svg]]
#+end_example

#+vindex: org-export-docbook-inline-image-extensions

By default, DocBook exporter recognizes the following image file
types: {{{file(jpeg)}}}, {{{file(jpg)}}}, {{{file(png)}}},
{{{file(gif)}}}, and {{{file(svg)}}}.  You can customize variable
~org-export-docbook-inline-image-extensions~ to add more types to this
list as long as DocBook supports them.

*** Special characters
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How to handle special characters
    :TITLE:    Special characters in DocBook export
    :END:
#+vindex: org-export-docbook-doctype
#+vindex: org-entities

Special characters that are written in TeX-like syntax, such as
~\alpha~, ~\Gamma~, and ~\Zeta~, are supported by DocBook exporter.
These characters are rewritten to XML entities, like ~&alpha;~,
~&Gamma;~, and ~&Zeta;~, based on the list saved in variable
~org-entities~.  As long as the generated DocBook file includes the
corresponding entities, these special characters are recognized.

You can customize variable ~org-export-docbook-doctype~ to include the
entities you need.  For example, you can set variable
~org-export-docbook-doctype~ to the following value to recognize all
special characters included in XHTML entities:

#+begin_example
   "<!DOCTYPE article [
   <!ENTITY % xhtml1-symbol PUBLIC
   \"-//W3C//ENTITIES Symbol for HTML//EN//XML\"
   \"http://www.w3.org/2003/entities/2007/xhtml1-symbol.ent\"

  If ~org-export-odt-preferred-output-format~ is specified,
  automatically convert the exported file to that format.  See
  [[Automatically exporting to other formats]].

  For an Org file {{{file(myfile.org)}}}, the ODT file will be
  {{{file(myfile.odt)}}}.  The file will be overwritten without warning.
  If there is an active region, only the region will be
  exported.[fn:133] If the selected region is a single tree, the tree
  head will become the document title.[fn:134] If the tree head entry

  converted file instead.  See [[x-export-to-other-formats][Automatically exporting to other formats]].

*** Extending ODT export
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How to produce ~doc~, ~pdf~ files
    :END:

The ODT exporter can interface with a variety of document converters
and supports popular converters out of the box.  As a result, you can
use it to export to formats like {{{samp(doc)}}} or convert a document
from one format (say {{{samp(csv)}}}) to another format (say
{{{samp(ods)}}} or {{{samp(xls)}}}).

#+cindex: @file{unoconv}
#+cindex: LibreOffice

If you have a working installation of LibreOffice, a document
converter is pre-configured for you and you can use it right away.  If
you would like to use {{{file(unoconv)}}} as your preferred converter,
customize the variable ~org-export-odt-convert-process~ to point to
~unoconv~.  You can also use your own favorite converter or tweak the
default settings of the {{{file(LibreOffice)}}} and
{{{samp(unoconv)}}} converters.  See [[Configuring a document converter]].

**** Automatically exporting to other formats
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Automatic conversion to doc, docx, etc.
     :END:
<<x-export-to-other-formats>>

#+vindex: org-export-odt-preferred-output-format

Very often, you will find yourself exporting to ODT format, only to
immediately save the exported document to other formats like
{{{samp(doc)}}}, {{{samp(docx)}}}, {{{samp(rtf)}}}, {{{samp(pdf)}}}
etc.  In such cases, you can specify your preferred output format by
customizing the variable ~org-export-odt-preferred-output-format~.
This way, the export commands (see [[x-export-to-odt][Exporting to ODT]])
can be extended to export to a format that is of immediate interest to
you.

**** Converting between document formats
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Interacting with configured converters
     :END:
# <<x-convert-to-other-formats>>

There are many document converters in the wild that support
conversion to and from various file formats, including, but not
limited to the ODT format.  LibreOffice converter, mentioned above, is
one such converter.  Once a converter is configured, you can interact
with it using the following command.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(M-x org-export-odt-convert)}}} ::
  #+vindex: org-export-odt-convert

  Convert an existing document from one format to another.  With a prefix

*** Applying custom styles
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How to apply custom styles to the output
    :END:
#+cindex: styles, custom

The ODT exporter ships with a set of OpenDocument styles 
(see [[Working with OpenDocument style files]]) that ensure a well-formatted output.
These factory styles, however, may not cater to your specific tastes.
To customize the output, you can either modify the above styles files
directly, or generate the required styles using an application like
LibreOffice.  The latter method is suitable for expert and non-expert
users alike, and is described here.

Custom styles can be applied in three easy steps:

1. Create a sample {{{file(example.org)}}} file with the below
   settings and export it to ODT format.

   #+begin_example
      ,#+OPTIONS: H:10 num:t
   #+end_example

2. Open the above {{{file(example.odt)}}} using LibreOffice.  Use the
   {{{file(Stylist)}}} to locate the target styles---these typically
   have the {{{samp(Org)}}} prefix---and modify those to your taste.
   Save the modified file either as an OpenDocument Text
   ({{{file(.odt)}}}) or OpenDocument Template ({{{file(.ott)}}})
   file.

3. Customize the variable ~org-export-odt-styles-file~ and point it to
   the newly created file.  For additional configuration options see
   [[x-overriding-factory-styles][Overriding factory styles]].

   #+cindex: #+ODT_STYLES_FILE
   #+vindex: org-export-odt-styles-file

   If you would like to choose a style on a per-file basis, you can use
   the ~#+ODT_STYLES_FILE~ option.  A typical setting will look like
   one of these two examples:

   #+begin_example
      ,#+ODT_STYLES_FILE: "/path/to/example.ott"
   #+end_example

   or

   #+begin_example
      ,#+ODT_STYLES_FILE: ("/path/to/file.ott" ("styles.xml" "image/hdr.png"))
   #+end_example

Although you can use third-party styles and templates for customizing
your output, this will produce the desired output only if the template
provides all style names that the {{{samp(ODT)}}} exporter relies
upon.  Unless this condition is met, the output is going to be less
than satisfactory.  It is highly recommended that you only work with
templates that are directly derived from the factory settings.

*** Links in ODT export
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How links will be interpreted and formatted
    :END:
#+cindex: tables, in DocBook export

ODT exporter creates native cross-references for internal links.  It
creates Internet-style links for all other links.

A link with no description and destined to a regular (un-itemized)
outline heading is replaced with a cross-reference and section number
of the heading.

A ~\ref{label}~-style reference to an image, table etc.  is replaced
with a cross-reference and sequence number of the labeled entity.  See
[[Labels and captions in ODT export]].

*** Tables in ODT export
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How tables are exported
    :END:

#+cindex: tables, in DocBook export

Export of native Org mode tables (see [[Tables]]) and simple
{{{file(table.el)}}} tables is supported.  However, export of complex
{{{file(table.el)}}} tables---tables that have column or row
spans---is not supported.  Such tables are stripped from the exported
document.

By default, a table is exported with top and bottom frames and with
rules separating row and column groups (see [[Column groups]]).
Furthermore, all tables are typeset to occupy the same width.  If the
table specifies alignment and relative width for its columns (see
[[Column width and alignment]]) then these are honored on export.[fn:135]

#+cindex: #+ATTR_ODT

You can control the width of the table by specifying ~:rel-width~
property using an ~#+ATTR_ODT~ line.

For example, consider the following table which makes use of all the
rules mentioned above.

#+begin_example
   #+ATTR_ODT: :rel-width 50
   | Area/Month    |   Jan |   Feb |   Mar |   Sum |
   |---------------+-------+-------+-------+-------|
   | /             |     < |       |       |     < |
   | <l13>         |  <r5> |  <r5> |  <r5> |  <r6> |
   | North America |     1 |    21 |   926 |   948 |
   | Middle East   |     6 |    75 |   844 |   925 |
   | Asia Pacific  |     9 |    27 |   790 |   826 |
   |---------------+-------+-------+-------+-------|
   | Sum           |    16 |   123 |  2560 |  2699 |
#+end_example

On export, the table will occupy 50% of text area.  The columns will be
sized (roughly) in the ratio of 13:5:5:5:6.  The first column will be
left-aligned and rest of the columns will be right-aligned.  There will
be vertical rules after separating the header and last columns from
other columns.  There will be horizontal rules separating the header
and last rows from other rows.

If you are not satisfied with the above formatting options, you can
create custom table styles and associate them with a table using the
~#+ATTR_ODT~ line.  See [[Customizing tables in ODT export]].

*** Images in ODT export
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How to insert images
    :END:
#+cindex: images, embedding in ODT
#+cindex: embedding images in ODT

You can embed images within the exported document by providing a link to the
desired image file with no link description.  For example, to embed
{{{samp(img.png)}}} do either of the following:

#+begin_example
   [[file:img.png]]
#+end_example

#+begin_example
   [[./img.png]]
#+end_example

You can create clickable images by providing a link whose description
is a link to an image file.  For example, to embed an image
{{{file(org-mode-unicorn.png)}}}, which when clicked jumps to
[[https://orgmode.org]] website, do the following:

#+begin_example
   [[https://orgmode.org][./org-mode-unicorn.png]]
#+end_example

#+cindex: #+ATTR_ODT

You can control the size and scale of the embedded images using the
~#+ATTR_ODT~ attribute.

#+cindex: identify, ImageMagick
#+vindex: org-export-odt-pixels-per-inch

The exporter specifies the desired size of the image in the final
document in units of centimeters.  In order to scale the embedded
images, the exporter queries for pixel dimensions of the images using
either ImageMagick's {{{file(identify)}}} program, or Emacs'
`create-image' and `image-size' APIs.[fn:136] The pixel dimensions are
subsequently converted to centimeters using
~org-export-odt-pixels-per-inch~.  The default value of this variable
is set to ~display-pixels-per-inch~.  You can tweak this variable to
achieve the best results.

The examples below illustrate the various possibilities.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- Explicitly size the image ::

  To embed {{{file(img.png)}}} as a 10 cm x 10 cm image, do the
  following:

  #+begin_example
     #+ATTR_ODT: :width 10 :height 10
     [[./img.png]]
  #+end_example

- Scale the image ::

  To embed {{{file(img.png)}}} at half its size, do the following:

  #+begin_example
     #+ATTR_ODT: :scale 0.5
     [[./img.png]]
  #+end_example

- Scale the image to a specific width ::

  To embed {{{file(img.png)}}} with a width of 10 cm while retaining the
  original height:width ratio, do the following:

  #+begin_example
     #+ATTR_ODT: :width 10
     [[./img.png]]
  #+end_example

- Scale the image to a specific height ::

  To embed {{{file(img.png)}}} with a height of 10 cm while retaining
  the original height:width ratio, do the following:

  #+begin_example
     #+ATTR_ODT: :height 10
     [[./img.png]]
  #+end_example

#+cindex: #+ATTR_ODT

You can control the manner in which an image is anchored by setting
the ~:anchor~ property of it's ~#+ATTR_ODT~ line.  You can specify one
of the the following three values for the ~:anchor~ property -
{{{samp("as-char")}}}, {{{samp("paragraph")}}} and {{{samp("page")}}}.

To create an image that is anchored to a page, do the following:

#+begin_example
   #+ATTR_ODT: :anchor "page"
   [[./img.png]]
#+end_example

*** Math formatting in ODT export
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How LaTeX fragments are formatted
    :END:

The ODT exporter has special support for handling math.

**** Working with LaTeX math snippets
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: How to embed LaTeX math fragments
     :END:

LaTeX math snippets (see [[LaTeX fragments]]) can be embedded in the ODT
document in one of the following ways:

#+cindex: MathML
#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- MathML ::

  This option is activated on a per-file basis with the following option:

  #+begin_example
     ,#+OPTIONS: LaTeX:t
  #+end_example

  With this option, LaTeX fragments are first converted into MathML
  fragments using an external LaTeX-to-MathML converter program.  The
  resulting MathML fragments are then embedded as an OpenDocument Formula in
  the exported document.

  #+vindex: org-latex-to-mathml-convert-command
  #+vindex: org-latex-to-mathml-jar-file

  You can specify the LaTeX-to-MathML converter by customizing the variables
  ~org-latex-to-mathml-convert-command~ and
  ~org-latex-to-mathml-jar-file~.

  If you prefer to use {{{file(MathToWeb)}}} as your converter, you can
  configure the above variables as shown below.[fn:137]

  #+header: :eval no
  #+header: :exports code
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-latex-to-mathml-convert-command
        "java -jar %j -unicode -force -df %o %I"
        org-latex-to-mathml-jar-file
        "/path/to/mathtoweb.jar")
  #+end_src

  You can use the following commands to quickly verify the reliability of
  the LaTeX-to-MathML converter.

  - {{{kbd(M-x org-export-as-odf)}}} ::

    Convert a LaTeX math snippet to an OpenDocument formula
    ({{{file(.odf)}}}) file.

  - {{{kbd(M-x org-export-as-odf-and-open)}}} ::

    Convert a LaTeX math snippet to an OpenDocument formula
    ({{{file(.odf)}}}) file and open the formula file with the
    system-registered application.

- PNG images ::
  #+cindex: dvipng

  This option is activated on a per-file basis with

  #+begin_example
     ,#+OPTIONS: LaTeX:dvipng
  #+end_example

  With this option, LaTeX fragments are processed into PNG images and
  the resulting images are embedded in the exported document.  This
  method requires that the {{{file(dvipng)}}} program be available on
  your system.

**** Working with MathML or OpenDocument formula files
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: How to embed equations in native format
     :END:

For various reasons, you may find embedding LaTeX math snippets in
an ODT document less than reliable.  In that case, you can embed a math
equation by linking to its MathML ({{{file(.mml)}}}) source or its
OpenDocument formula ({{{file(.odf)}}}) file as shown below:

#+begin_example
   [[./equation.mml]]
#+end_example

or

#+begin_example
   [[./equation.odf]]
#+end_example

*** Labels and captions in ODT export
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How captions are rendered
    :END:

You can label and caption various category of objects---an inline
image, a table, a LaTeX fragment or a Math formula---using
~#+LABEL~ and ~#+CAPTION~ lines.  See [[Images and tables]].  ODT exporter
enumerates each labeled or captioned object of a given category
separately.  As a result, each such object is assigned a sequence
number based on order of its appearance in the Org file.

In the exported document, a user-provided caption is augmented with
the category and sequence number.  Consider the following inline image
in an Org file:

#+begin_example
   ,#+CAPTION: Bell curve
   ,#+LABEL:   fig:SED-HR4049
   [[./img/a.png]]
#+end_example

It could be rendered as shown below in the exported document.

#+begin_example
   Figure 2: Bell curve
#+end_example

#+vindex: org-export-odt-category-strings

You can modify the category component of the caption by customizing
the variable ~org-export-odt-category-strings~.  For example, to tag
all embedded images with the string {{{samp(Illustration)}}} (instead
of the default {{{samp(Figure)}}}) use the following setting.

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-export-odt-category-strings
      '(("en" "Table" "Illustration" "Equation" "Equation")))
#+end_src

With this, previous image will be captioned as below in the exported
document.

#+begin_example
   Illustration 2: Bell curve
#+end_example

*** Literal examples in ODT export
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How source and example blocks are formatted
    :END:

Export of literal examples (see [[Literal examples]]) with full
fontification is supported.  Internally, the exporter relies on
{{{file(htmlfontify.el)}}} to generate all style definitions needed
for a fancy listing.[fn:138] The auto-generated styles have
{{{samp(OrgSrc)}}} as prefix and inherit their color from the faces
used by Emacs ~font-lock~ library for the source language.

#+vindex: org-export-odt-fontify-srcblocks

If you prefer to use your own custom styles for fontification, you can
do so by customizing the variable
~org-export-odt-create-custom-styles-for-srcblocks~.

#+vindex: org-export-odt-create-custom-styles-for-srcblocks

You can turn off fontification of literal examples by customizing the
variable ~org-export-odt-fontify-srcblocks~.

*** Advanced topics in ODT export
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Read this if you are a power user
    :END:

If you rely heavily on ODT export, you may want to exploit the full
set of features that the exporter offers.  This section describes
features that would be of interest to power users.

**** Configuring a document converter
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: How to register a document converter
     :END:
#+cindex: convert
#+cindex: doc, docx, rtf
#+cindex: converter

The ODT exporter can work with popular converters with little or no
extra configuration from your side.  See [[Extending ODT export]].  If you
are using a converter that is not supported by default or if you would
like to tweak the default converter settings, proceed as below.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- Register the converter ::

  #+vindex: org-export-odt-convert-processes

  Name your converter and add it to the list of known converters by
  customizing the variable ~org-export-odt-convert-processes~.  Also
  specify how the converter can be invoked via command-line to effect
  the conversion.

- Configure its capabilities ::

  #+vindex: org-export-odt-convert-capabilities
  # <<x-odt-converter-capabilities>>

  Specify the set of formats the converter can handle by customizing the
  variable ~org-export-odt-convert-capabilities~.  Use the default value
  for this variable as a guide for configuring your converter.  As suggested by
  the default setting, you can specify the full set of formats supported by the
  converter and not limit yourself to specifying formats that are related to
  just the OpenDocument Text format.

- Choose the converter ::

  #+vindex: org-export-odt-convert-process

  Select the newly added converter as the preferred one by customizing the
  variable ~org-export-odt-convert-process~.

**** Working with OpenDocument style files
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Explore the internals
     :END:
#+cindex: styles, custom
#+cindex: template, custom

This section explores the internals of the ODT exporter and the means
by which it produces styled documents.  Read this section if you are
interested in exploring the automatic and custom OpenDocument styles
used by the exporter.

# <<x-factory-styles>>

The ODT exporter relies on two files for generating its output.
These files are bundled with the distribution under the directory pointed to
by the variable ~org-odt-styles-dir~.  The two files are:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{file(OrgOdtStyles.xml)}}} ::
  <<x-orgodtstyles-xml>>

  This file contributes to the {{{file(styles.xml)}}} file of the final
  {{{samp(ODT)}}} document.  This file is modified to control outline
  numbering based on user settings, and To add styles generated by
  {{{file(htmlfontify.el)}}} for fontification of code blocks.

- {{{file(OrgOdtContentTemplate.xml)}}} ::
  <<x-orgodtcontenttemplate-xml>>

  This file contributes to the {{{file(content.xml)}}} file of the final
  {{{samp(ODT)}}} document.  The contents of the Org outline are inserted
  between the ~<office:text>~ and ~</office:text>~
  elements of this file.

  In addition to serving as a template file for the final
  {{{file(content.xml)}}}, the file also contains automatic styles for
  formatting of tables which are referenced by the exporter, and
  ~<text:sequence-decl>~ ...  ~</text:sequence-decl>~
  elements that control how various entities---tables, images,
  equations, etc.---are numbered.


<<x-overriding-factory-styles>>

The following two variables control the location from which the ODT
exporter picks up the custom styles and content template files.  You
can customize these variables to override the factory styles used by
the exporter.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~org-export-odt-styles-file~ ::
  <<x-org-export-odt-styles-file>>

  Use this variable to specify the {{{file(styles.xml)}}} that will be
  used in the final output.  You can specify one of the following values:

  - A {{{file(styles.xml)}}} file ::

    Use this file instead of the default {{{file(styles.xml)}}}

  - A {{{file(.odt)}}} or {{{file(.ott)}}} file ::

    Use the {{{file(styles.xml)}}} contained in the specified OpenDocument
    Text or Template file.

  - A {{{file(.odt)}}} or {{{file(.ott)}}} file and a subset of files contained within them ::

    Use the {{{file(styles.xml)}}} contained in the specified OpenDocument
    Text or Template file.  Additionally extract the specified member files
    and embed those within the final {{{samp(ODT)}}} document.

    Use this option if the {{{file(styles.xml)}}} file references
    additional files like header and footer images.

  - ~nil~ ::

    Use the default {{{file(styles.xml)}}}

- ~org-export-odt-content-template-file~ ::
  <<x-org-export-odt-content-template-file>>

  Use this variable to specify the blank {{{file(content.xml)}}} that
  will be used in the final output.

**** Creating one-off styles
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: How to produce custom highlighting, etc.
     :END:

There are times when you would want one-off formatting in the exported
document.  You can achieve this by embedding raw OpenDocument XML in
the Org file.  The use of this feature is better illustrated with
couple of examples.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- Embedding ODT tags as part of regular text ::

  You can include simple OpenDocument tags by prefixing them with
  {{{samp(@)}}}.  For example, to highlight a region of text do the
  following:

  #+begin_example
     @<text:span text:style-name="Highlight">This is a
     highlighted text@</text:span>.  But this is a
     regular text.
  #+end_example

  *Hint:* To see the above example in action, edit your
  {{{file(styles.xml)}}} (see [[x-orgodtstyles-xml][Factory styles]]) and
  add a custom {{{samp(Highlight)}}} style as shown below.

  #+begin_example
     <style:style style:name="Highlight" style:family="text">
       <style:text-properties fo:background-color="#ff0000"/>
     </style:style>
  #+end_example

- Embedding a one-line OpenDocument XML ::

  You can add a simple OpenDocument one-liner using the ~#+ODT:~
  directive.  For example, to force a page break do the following:

  #+begin_example
     #+ODT: <text:p text:style-name="PageBreak"/>
  #+end_example

  *Hint:* To see the above example in action, edit your
  {{{file(styles.xml)}}} (see [[x-orgodtstyles-xml][Factory styles]]) and
  add a custom {{{samp(PageBreak)}}} style as shown below.

  #+begin_example
     <style:style style:name="PageBreak" style:family="paragraph"
                  style:parent-style-name="Text_20_body">
       <style:paragraph-properties fo:break-before="page"/>
     </style:style>
  #+end_example

- Embedding a block of OpenDocument XML ::

  You can add a large block of OpenDocument XML using the
  ~#+BEGIN_ODT~ ...  ~#+END_ODT~ construct.

  For example, to create a one-off paragraph that uses bold text, do the
  following:

  #+begin_example
     #+BEGIN_ODT
     <text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body_20_bold">
     This paragraph is specially formatted and uses bold text.
     </text:p>
     #+END_ODT
  #+end_example

**** Customizing tables in ODT export
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: How to define and use table templates
     :END:
#+cindex: tables, in ODT export
#+cindex: #+ATTR_ODT

You can override the default formatting of the table by specifying a
custom table style with the ~#+ATTR_ODT~ line.  For a discussion on
default formatting of tables see [[Tables in ODT export]].

This feature closely mimics the way table templates are defined in the
OpenDocument-v1.2 specification.[fn:139]

To have a quick preview of this feature, install the following setting and
export the example table.

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-export-odt-table-styles
        (append org-export-odt-table-styles
                '(("TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn" "Custom"
                   ((use-first-row-styles . t)
                    (use-first-column-styles . t)))
                  ("TableWithFirstRowandLastRow" "Custom"
                   ((use-first-row-styles . t)
                    (use-last-row-styles . t))))))
#+end_src

#+begin_example
   ,#+ATTR_ODT: :style "TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn"
   | Name  | Phone | Age |
   | Peter |  1234 |  17 |
   | Anna  |  4321 |  25 |
#+end_example

In the above example, you used a template named {{{samp(Custom)}}} and
installed two table styles with the names
{{{samp(TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn)}}} and
{{{samp(TableWithFirstRowandLastRow)}}}.  (*Important:* The
OpenDocument styles needed for producing the above template have been
pre-defined for you.  These styles are available under the section
marked {{{samp(Custom Table Template)}}} in
{{{file(OrgOdtContentTemplate.xml)}}} (see
[[x-orgodtcontenttemplate-xml][Factory styles]]).  If you need additional
templates you have to define these styles yourself.


To use this feature proceed as follows:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- Create a table template[fn:140] ::

  A table template is nothing but a set of {{{samp(table-cell)}}} and
  {{{samp(paragraph)}}} styles for each of the following table cell
  categories:

    - Body
    - First column
    - Last column
    - First row
    - Last row
    - Even row
    - Odd row
    - Even column
    - Odd Column

  The names for the above styles must be chosen based on the name of the
  table template using a well-defined convention.

  The naming convention is better illustrated with an example.  For a
  table template with the name {{{samp(Custom)}}}, the needed style
  names are listed in the following table.

  | Table cell type | ~table-cell~ style                     | ~paragraph~ style                           |
  |-----------------+----------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------|
  | Body            | {{{samp(CustomTableCell)}}}            | {{{samp(CustomTableParagraph)}}}            |
  | First column    | {{{samp(CustomFirstColumnTableCell)}}} | {{{samp(CustomFirstColumnTableParagraph)}}} |
  | Last column     | {{{samp(CustomLastColumnTableCell)}}}  | {{{samp(CustomLastColumnTableParagraph)}}}  |
  | First row       | {{{samp(CustomFirstRowTableCell)}}}    | {{{samp(CustomFirstRowTableParagraph)}}}    |
  | Last row        | {{{samp(CustomLastRowTableCell)}}}     | {{{samp(CustomLastRowTableParagraph)}}}     |
  | Even row        | {{{samp(CustomEvenRowTableCell)}}}     | {{{samp(CustomEvenRowTableParagraph)}}}     |
  | Odd row         | {{{samp(CustomOddRowTableCell)}}}      | {{{samp(CustomOddRowTableParagraph)}}}      |
  | Even column     | {{{samp(CustomEvenColumnTableCell)}}}  | {{{samp(CustomEvenColumnTableParagraph)}}}  |
  | Odd column      | {{{samp(CustomOddColumnTableCell)}}}   | {{{samp(CustomOddColumnTableParagraph)}}}   |


  To create a table template with the name {{{samp(Custom)}}}, define
  the above styles in the ~<office:automatic-styles>~ ...
  ~</office:automatic-styles>~ element of the content template file (see
  [[x-orgodtcontenttemplate-xml][Factory styles]]).

- Define a table style[fn:141] ::

  #+vindex: org-export-odt-table-styles

  To define a table style, create an entry for the style in the variable
  ~org-export-odt-table-styles~ and specify the following:

    - the name of the table template created in step (1)
    - the set of cell styles in that template that are to be activated


  For example, the entry below defines two different table styles
  {{{samp(TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn)}}} and
  {{{samp(TableWithFirstRowandLastRow)}}} based on the same template
  {{{samp(Custom)}}}.  The styles achieve their intended effect by
  selectively activating the individual cell styles in that template.

  #+header: :eval no
  #+header: :exports code
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-export-odt-table-styles
        (append org-export-odt-table-styles
                '(("TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn" "Custom"

**** Validating OpenDocument XML
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: How to debug corrupt OpenDocument files
     :END:

Occasionally, you will discover that the document created by the ODT
exporter cannot be opened by your favorite application.  One of the
common reasons for this is that the {{{file(.odt)}}} file is corrupt.
In such cases, you may want to validate the document against the
OpenDocument RELAX NG Compact Syntax (RNC) schema.

For de-compressing the {{{file(.odt)}}} file[fn:142]:
[[info:emacs#File Archives]].  For general help with validation (and
schema-sensitive editing) of XML files: [[info:nxml-mode#Introduction]].
#+vindex: org-export-odt-schema-dir

If you have ready access to OpenDocument {{{file(.rnc)}}} files and
the needed schema-locating rules in a single folder, you can customize
the variable ~org-export-odt-schema-dir~ to point to that directory.
The ODT exporter will take care of updating the
~rng-schema-locating-files~ for you.

** TaskJuggler export
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Exporting to TaskJuggler
   :END:
#+cindex: TaskJuggler export
#+cindex: Project management

[[http://www.taskjuggler.org/][TaskJuggler]] is a project management tool.  It provides an optimizing
scheduler that computes your project time lines and resource
assignments based on the project outline and the constraints that you
have provided.

The TaskJuggler exporter is a bit different from other exporters, such
as the ~HTML~ and LaTeX exporters for example, in that it does not
export all the nodes of a document or strictly follow the order of the
nodes in the document.

Instead the TaskJuggler exporter looks for a tree that defines the
tasks and optionally trees that define the resources and reports for
this project.  It then creates a TaskJuggler file based on these trees
and the attributes defined in all the nodes.

*** TaskJuggler export commands
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Key bindings for TaskJuggler export
    :END:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-e j)}}}, ~org-export-as-taskjuggler~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e j

  Export as a TaskJuggler file.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-e J)}}}, ~org-export-as-taskjuggler-and-open~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e J

  Export as a TaskJuggler file and then open the file with TaskJugglerUI
  (only for TaskJugglerUI 2.x).

*** Tasks
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Marking tasks for TaskJuggler export
    :END:
#+vindex: org-export-taskjuggler-project-tag

Create your tasks as you usually do with Org mode.  Assign efforts to
each task using properties (it is easiest to do this in the column
view).  You should end up with something similar to the example by
Peter Jones in
[[http://www.contextualdevelopment.com/static/artifacts/articles/2008/project-planning/project-planning.org]].
Now mark the top node of your tasks with a tag named
~:taskjuggler_project:~ (or whatever you customized
~org-export-taskjuggler-project-tag~ to).  You are now ready to export
the project plan with {{{kbd(C-c C-e J)}}} which will export the
project plan and open a gantt chart in TaskJugglerUI.

*** Resources
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Define TaskJuggler resources
    :END:
#+vindex: org-export-taskjuggler-resource-tag

Next you can define resources and assign those to work on specific
tasks.  You can group your resources hierarchically.  Tag the top node
of the resources with ~:taskjuggler_resource:~ (or whatever you
customized ~org-export-taskjuggler-resource-tag~ to).  You can
optionally assign an identifier (named {{{samp(resource_id)}}}) to the
resources (using the standard Org properties commands, see [[Property
syntax]]) or you can let the exporter generate identifiers automatically
(the exporter picks the first word of the headline as the identifier
as long as it is unique---see the documentation of
~org-taskjuggler-get-unique-id~).  Using that identifier you can then
allocate resources to tasks.  This is again done with the
{{{samp(allocate)}}} property on the tasks.  Do this in column view or
when on the task type 
{{{ksksksk(C-c C-x p allocate,RET,<resource_id>,RET)}}}.

Once the allocations are done you can again export to TaskJuggler and
check in the Resource Allocation Graph which person is working on what
task at what time.

*** Export of properties
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Which properties will be exported?
    :END:

The exporter also takes TODO state information into consideration,
i.e., if a task is marked as done it will have the corresponding
attribute in TaskJuggler ({{{samp(complete 100)}}}).  Scheduling
information is also taken into account to set start/end dates for
tasks.

The exporter will also export any property on a task resource or
resource node which is known to TaskJuggler, such as
{{{samp(limits)}}}, {{{samp(vacation)}}}, {{{samp(shift)}}},
{{{samp(booking)}}}, {{{samp(efficiency)}}}, {{{samp(journalentry)}}},
{{{samp(rate)}}} for resources or {{{samp(account)}}},
{{{samp(start)}}}, {{{samp(note)}}}, {{{samp(duration)}}},
{{{samp(end)}}}, {{{samp(journalentry)}}}, {{{samp(milestone)}}},
{{{samp(reference)}}}, {{{samp(responsible)}}},
{{{samp(scheduling)}}}, etc for tasks.

*** Dependencies
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: How the exporter handles dependencies
    :END:

The exporter will handle dependencies that are defined in the tasks
either with the {{{samp(ORDERED)}}} attribute (see [[TODO dependencies]]),
with the {{{samp(BLOCKER)}}} attribute (see {{{file(org-depend.el)}}})
or alternatively with a {{{samp(depends)}}} attribute.  Both the
{{{samp(BLOCKER)}}} and the {{{samp(depends)}}} attribute can be
either {{{samp(previous-sibling)}}} or a reference to an identifier
(named {{{samp(task_id)}}}) which is defined for another task in the
project.  {{{samp(BLOCKER)}}} and the {{{samp(depends)}}} attribute can
define multiple dependencies separated by either space or comma.  You
can also specify optional attributes on the dependency by simply
appending it.  The following examples should illustrate this:

#+begin_example
   ,* Preparation
   ,  :PROPERTIES:
   ,  :task_id:  preparation
   ,  :ORDERED:  t
   ,  :END:
   ,* Training material
   ,  :PROPERTIES:
   ,  :task_id:  training_material
   ,  :ORDERED:  t
   ,  :END:

   ,  :PROPERTIES:
   ,  :Effort:   2d
   ,  :BLOCKER:  training_material { gapduration 1d } preparation
   ,  :END:
#+end_example

*** Reports
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Gantt charts, etc.
    :END:
#+vindex: org-export-taskjuggler-default-reports

TaskJuggler can produce many kinds of reports (e.g., gantt chart,
resource allocation, etc).  The user defines what kind of reports
should be generated for a project in the TaskJuggler file.  By default,
the exporter will automatically insert some pre-set reports in the
file.  These defaults are defined in
~org-export-taskjuggler-default-reports~.  They can be modified using
customize along with a number of other options.  For a more complete
list, see 
{{{ksksksk(M-x customize-group,RET,org-export-taskjuggler,RET)}}}.

Alternately, the user can tag a tree with
~org-export-taskjuggler-report-tag~, and define reports in sub-nodes,
similarly to what is done with tasks or resources.  The properties used
for report generation are defined in
~org-export-taskjuggler-valid-report-attributes~.  In addition, a
special property named {{{samp(report-kind)}}} is used to define the
kind of report one wants to generate (by default, a
{{{samp(taskreport)}}}).

For more information and examples see the Org-taskjuggler tutorial at
[[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-taskjuggler.html]].

** Freemind export
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Exporting to Freemind mind maps
   :END:
#+cindex: Freemind export
#+cindex: mind map

The Freemind exporter was written by Lennart Borgman.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-e m)}}}, ~org-export-as-freemind~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e m

  Export as a Freemind mind map.  For an Org file {{{file(myfile.org)}}},
  the Freemind file will be {{{file(myfile.mm)}}}.

** XOXO export
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Exporting to XOXO
   :END:
#+cindex: XOXO export

Org mode contains an exporter that produces XOXO-style output.
Currently, this exporter only handles the general outline structure
and does not interpret any additional Org mode features.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-e x)}}}, ~org-export-as-xoxo~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e x

  Export as an XOXO file.  For an Org file {{{file(myfile.org)}}}, the
  XOXO file will be {{{file(myfile.html)}}}.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-e v x)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e v x

  Export only the visible part of the document.

** iCalendar export
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Exporting to iCalendar format
   :END:
#+cindex: iCalendar export

#+vindex: org-icalendar-include-todo
#+vindex: org-icalendar-use-deadline
#+vindex: org-icalendar-use-scheduled
#+vindex: org-icalendar-categories
#+vindex: org-icalendar-alarm-time

Some people use Org mode for keeping track of projects, but still
prefer a standard calendar application for anniversaries and
appointments.  In this case it can be useful to show deadlines and
other time-stamped items in Org files in the calendar application.  Org
mode can export calendar information in the standard iCalendar format.
If you also want to have TODO entries included in the export,
configure the variable ~org-icalendar-include-todo~.  Plain timestamps
are exported as VEVENT, and TODO items as VTODO.  It will also create
events from deadlines that are in non-TODO items.  Deadlines and
scheduling dates in TODO items will be used to set the start and due
dates for the TODO entry.[fn:143] As categories, it will use the tags
locally defined in the heading, and the file/tree category.[fn:144]
See the variable ~org-icalendar-alarm-time~ for a way to assign alarms
to entries with a time.

#+vindex: org-icalendar-store-UID
#+cindex: property, ID

The iCalendar standard requires each entry to have a globally unique
identifier (UID).  Org creates these identifiers during export.  If you
set the variable ~org-icalendar-store-UID~, the UID will be stored in
the ~:ID:~ property of the entry and re-used next time you report this
entry.  Since a single entry can give rise to multiple iCalendar
entries (as a timestamp, a deadline, a scheduled item, and as a TODO
item), Org adds prefixes to the UID, depending on what triggered the
inclusion of the entry.  In this way the UID remains unique, but a
synchronization program can still figure out from which entry all the
different instances originate.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-e i)}}}, ~org-export-icalendar-this-file~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e i

  Create iCalendar entries for the current file and store them in the
  same directory, using a file extension {{{file(.ics)}}}.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-e I)}}}, ~ org-export-icalendar-all-agenda-files~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e I
  #+vindex: org-agenda-files

  Like {{{kbd(C-c C-e i)}}}, but do this for all files in
  ~org-agenda-files~.  For each of these files, a separate iCalendar file
  will be written.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-e c)}}}, ~org-export-icalendar-combine-agenda-files~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e c
  #+vindex: org-combined-agenda-icalendar-file

  Create a single large iCalendar file from all files in
  ~org-agenda-files~ and write it to the file given by
  ~org-combined-agenda-icalendar-file~.


#+vindex: org-use-property-inheritance
#+vindex: org-icalendar-include-body
#+cindex: property, SUMMARY
#+cindex: property, DESCRIPTION
#+cindex: property, LOCATION

The export will honor SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION and LOCATION properties if
the selected entries have them.[fn:145] If not, the summary will be
derived from the headline, and the description from the body (limited
to ~org-icalendar-include-body~ characters).

How this calendar is best read and updated, depends on the application
you are using.  The FAQ covers this issue.

* Publishing
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: Create a web site of linked Org files
  :END:
#+cindex: publishing
#+cindex: O'Toole, David

Org includes a publishing management system that allows you to
configure automatic HTML conversion of /projects/ composed of
interlinked org files.  You can also configure Org to automatically
upload your exported HTML pages and related attachments, such as
images and source code files, to a web server.

You can also use Org to convert files into PDF, or even combine HTML
and PDF conversion so that files are available in both formats on the
server.

Publishing has been contributed to Org by David O'Toole.

** Configuration
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Defining projects
   :END:
Publishing needs significant configuration to specify files,
destination and many other properties of a project.

*** Project alist
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: The central configuration variable
    :TITLE:    The variable ~org-publish-project-alist~
    :END:
#+cindex: org-publish-project-alist
#+cindex: projects, for publishing
#+vindex: org-publish-project-alist

Publishing is configured almost entirely through setting the value of
one variable, called ~org-publish-project-alist~.  Each element of the
list configures one project, and may be in one of the two following
forms:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
   ("project-name" :property value :property value ...)
#+end_src

i.e., a well-formed property list with alternating keys and values,
or:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
   ("project-name" :components ("project-name" "project-name" ...))
#+end_src

In both cases, projects are configured by specifying property values.
A project defines the set of files that will be published, as well as
the publishing configuration to use when publishing those files.  When
a project takes the second form listed above, the individual members
of the ~:components~ property are taken to be sub-projects, which
group together files requiring different publishing options.  When you
publish such a "meta-project," all the components will also be
published, in the sequence given.

*** Sources and destinations
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: From here to there
    :TITLE:    Sources and destinations for files
    :END:
#+cindex: directories, for publishing

Most properties are optional, but some should always be set.  In
particular, Org needs to know where to look for source files, and
where to put published files.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~:base-directory~ ::
 
  Directory containing publishing source files

- ~:publishing-directory~ ::

  Directory where output files will be published.  You can directly
  publish to a webserver using a file name syntax appropriate for the
  Emacs {{{file(tramp)}}} package.  Or you can publish to a local
  directory and use external tools to upload your website 
  (see [[Uploading files]]).

- ~:preparation-function~ ::

  Function or list of functions to be called before starting the
  publishing process, for example, to run ~make~ for updating files to
  be published.  The project property list is scoped into this call as
  the variable ~project-plist~.

- ~:completion-function~ ::

  Function or list of functions called after finishing the publishing
  process, for example, to change permissions of the resulting files.
  The project property list is scoped into this call as the variable
  ~project-plist~.

*** Selecting files
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: What files are part of the project?
    :END:
#+cindex: files, selecting for publishing

By default, all files with extension {{{file(.org)}}} in the base directory
are considered part of the project.  This can be modified by setting the
following properties:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~:base-extension~ ::

  Extension (without the dot!) of source files.  This actually is a
  regular expression.  Set this to the symbol ~any~ if you want to get
  all files in ~:base-directory~, even without extension.

- ~:exclude~ ::

  Regular expression to match file names that should not be published,
  even though they have been selected on the basis of their extension.

- ~:include~ ::

  List of files to be included regardless of ~:base-extension~ and
  ~:exclude~.

- ~:recursive~ ::

  Non-nil means, check base-directory recursively for files to publish.

*** Publishing action
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Setting the function doing the publishing
    :END:
#+cindex: action, for publishing

Publishing means that a file is copied to the destination directory and
possibly transformed in the process.  The default transformation is to export
Org files as HTML files, and this is done by the function
~org-publish-org-to-html~ which calls the HTML exporter (see [[HTML
export]]).  But you also can publish your content as PDF files using
~org-publish-org-to-pdf~, or as ~ascii~, ~latin1~ or
~utf8~ encoded files using the corresponding functions.  If you want to
publish the Org file itself, but with /archived/, /commented/, and
/tag-excluded/ trees removed, use ~org-publish-org-to-org~ and set the
parameters ~:plain-source~ and/or ~:htmlized-source~.  This will
produce {{{file(file.org)}}} and {{{file(file.org.html)}}} in the publishing
directory.[fn:146]  Other files like images only need to be copied to the
publishing destination; for this you may use ~org-publish-attachment~.
For non-Org files, you always need to specify the publishing function:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~:publishing-function~ ::

  Function executing the publication of a file.  This may also be a list
  of functions, which will all be called in turn.

- ~:plain-source~ ::

  Non-nil means, publish plain source.

- ~:htmlized-source~ ::

  Non-nil means, publish htmlized source.


The function must accept three arguments: a property list containing
at least a ~:publishing-directory~ property, the name of the file to
be published, and the path to the publishing directory of the output
file.  It should take the specified file, make the necessary
transformation (if any) and place the result into the destination
folder.

*** Publishing options
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Tweaking HTML/LaTeX export
    :END:
#+cindex: options, for publishing

The property list can be used to set many export options for the HTML
and LaTeX exporters.  In most cases, these properties correspond to user
variables in Org.  The table below lists these properties along
with the variable they belong to.  See the documentation string for the
respective variable for details.

Most of the ~org-export-with-*~ variables have the same effect in both
HTML and LaTeX exporters, except for ~:TeX-macros~ and
~:LaTeX-fragments~ options, respectively ~nil~ and ~t~ in the LaTeX
export.  See ~org-export-plist-vars~ to check this list of options.

#+vindex: org-publish-project-alist

When a property is given a value in ~org-publish-project-alist~, its
setting overrides the value of the corresponding user variable (if
any) during publishing.  Options set within a file (see [[Export
options]]), however, override everything.

*** Publishing links
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Which links keep working after publishing?
    :END:
#+cindex: links, publishing

To create a link from one Org file to another, you would use something
like ~[[file:foo.org][The foo]]~ or simply ~[[file:foo.org]]~ (see
[[Hyperlinks]]).  When published, this link becomes a link to
{{{file(foo.html)}}}.  In this way, you can interlink the pages of your
"org web" project and the links will work as expected when you publish
them to HTML.  If you also publish the Org source file and want to link
to that, use an ~http:~ link instead of a ~file:~ link, because
~file:~ links are converted to link to the corresponding
{{{file(html)}}} file.

You may also link to related files, such as images.  Provided you are
careful with relative file names, and provided you have also
configured Org to upload the related files, these links will work too.
See [[Complex example]], for an example of this usage.

Sometimes an Org file to be published may contain links that are only
valid in your production environment, but not in the publishing
location.  In this case, use the following property to define a
function for checking link validity:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~:link-validation-function~ ::
  Function to validate links


{{{noindent}}} This function must accept two arguments, the file name
and a directory relative to which the file name is interpreted in the
production environment.  If this function returns ~nil~, then the HTML
generator will only insert a description into the HTML file, but no
link.  One option for this function is ~org-publish-validate-link~
which checks if the given file is part of any project in
~org-publish-project-alist~.

*** Site map
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Generating a list of all pages
    :TITLE:    Generating a sitemap
    :END:
#+cindex: sitemap, of published pages

The following properties may be used to control publishing of
a map of files for a given project.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~:auto-sitemap~ ::

  When non-nil, publish a sitemap during ~org-publish-current-project~
  or ~org-publish-all~.

- ~:sitemap-filename~ ::

  Filename for output of sitemap.  Defaults to {{{file(sitemap.org)}}} (which
  becomes {{{file(sitemap.html)}}}).

- ~:sitemap-title~ ::

  Title of sitemap page.  Defaults to name of file.

- ~:sitemap-function~ ::

  Plug-in function to use for generation of the sitemap.  Defaults to
  ~org-publish-org-sitemap~, which generates a plain list of links to
  all files in the project.

- ~:sitemap-sort-folders~ ::

  Where folders should appear in the sitemap.  Set this to ~first~
  (default) or ~last~ to display folders first or last, respectively.
  Any other value will mix files and folders.

- ~:sitemap-sort-files~ ::

  How the files are sorted in the site map.  Set this to ~alphabetically~
  (default), ~chronologically~ or ~anti-chronologically~.
  ~chronologically~ sorts the files with older date first while
  ~anti-chronologically~ sorts the files with newer date first.
  ~alphabetically~ sorts the files alphabetically.  The date of a file is
  retrieved with ~org-publish-find-date~.

- ~:sitemap-ignore-case~ ::

  Should sorting be case-sensitive?  Default ~nil~.

- ~:sitemap-file-entry-format~ ::

  With this option one can tell how a sitemap's entry is formatted in
  the sitemap.  This is a format string with some escape sequences: ~%t~
  stands for the title of the file, ~%a~ stands for the author of the
  file and ~%d~ stands for the date of the file.  The date is retrieved
  with the ~org-publish-find-date~ function and formatted with
  ~org-publish-sitemap-date-format~.  Default ~%t~.

- ~:sitemap-date-format~ ::

  Format string for the ~format-time-string~ function that tells how a
  sitemap entry's date is to be formatted.  This property bypasses
  ~org-publish-sitemap-date-format~ which defaults to ~%Y-%m-%d~.

- ~:sitemap-sans-extension~ ::

  When non-nil, remove filenames' extensions from the generated sitemap.
  Useful to have cool URIs (see [[http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI]]).
  Defaults to ~nil~.

*** Generating an index
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: An index that reaches across pages
    :END:
#+cindex: index, in a publishing project

Org mode can generate an index across the files of a publishing project.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~:makeindex~ ::

  When non-nil, generate in index in the file {{{file(theindex.org)}}}
  and publish it as {{{file(theindex.html)}}}.


The file will be created when first publishing a project with the
~:makeindex~ set.  The file only contains a statement
{{{samp(#+INCLUDE: "theindex.inc")}}}.  You can then build around this
include statement by adding a title, style information, etc.

** Uploading files
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: How to get files up on the server
   :END:
#+cindex: rsync
#+cindex: unison

For those people already utilizing third party sync tools such as
{{{command(rsync)}}} or {{{command(unison)}}}, it might be preferable
not to use the built in remote publishing facilities of Org mode
which rely heavily on Tramp.  Tramp, while very useful and powerful,
tends not to be so efficient for multiple file transfer and has been
known to cause problems under heavy usage.

Specialized synchronization utilities offer several advantages.  In
addition to timestamp comparison, they also do content and
permissions/attribute checks.  For this reason you might prefer to
publish your web to a local directory (possibly even in place with
your Org files) and then use {{{file(unison)}}} or {{{file(rsync)}}}
to do the synchronization with the remote host.

Since Unison (for example) can be configured as to which files to
transfer to a certain remote destination, it can greatly simplify the
project publishing definition.  Simply keep all files in the correct
location, process your Org files with ~org-publish~ and let the
synchronization tool do the rest.  You do not need, in this scenario,
to include attachments such as {{{file(jpg)}}}, {{{file(css)}}} or
{{{file(gif)}}} files in the project definition since the 3rd party
tool syncs them.

Publishing to a local directory is also much faster than to a remote
one, so that you can afford more easily to republish entire projects.
If you set ~org-publish-use-timestamps-flag~ to ~nil~, you gain the
main benefit of re-including any changed external files such as source
example files you might include with ~#+INCLUDE:~.  The timestamp
mechanism in Org is not smart enough to detect if included files have
been modified.

** Sample configuration
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Example projects
   :END:
Below we provide two example configurations.  The first one is a simple
project publishing only a set of Org files.  The second example is
more complex, with a multi-component project.

*** Simple example
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: One-component publishing
    :TITLE:    Example: simple publishing configuration
    :END:
This example publishes a set of Org files to the {{{file(public_html)}}}
directory on the local machine.

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      '(("org"
         :base-directory "~/org/"
         :publishing-directory "~/public_html"
         :section-numbers nil
         :table-of-contents nil
         :style "<link rel=\"stylesheet\"
                href=\"../other/mystyle.css\"
                type=\"text/css\"/>")))
#+end_src

*** Complex example
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: A multi-component publishing example
    :TITLE:    Example: complex publishing configuration
    :END:
This more complicated example publishes an entire website, including
Org files converted to HTML, image files, Emacs Lisp source code, and
style sheets.  The publishing directory is remote and private files are
excluded.

To ensure that links are preserved, care should be taken to replicate
your directory structure on the web server, and to use relative file
paths.  For example, if your Org files are kept in {{{file(~/org)}}}
and your publishable images in {{{file(~/images)}}}, you would link to
an image with

#+begin_example
   file:../images/myimage.png
#+end_example

On the web server, the relative path to the image should be the
same.  You can accomplish this by setting up an "images" folder in the
right place on the web server, and publishing images to it.

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

          :style "<link rel=\"stylesheet\"
                  href=\"../other/mystyle.css\" type=\"text/css\"/>"
          :html-preamble t)

         ("images"
          :base-directory "~/images/"
          :base-extension "jpg\\|gif\\|png"
          :publishing-directory "/ssh:user@@host:~/html/images/"
          :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)

         ("other"
          :base-directory "~/other/"
          :base-extension "css\\|el"
          :publishing-directory "/ssh:user@@host:~/html/other/"
          :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)
         ("website" :components ("orgfiles" "images" "other"))))
#+end_src

** Triggering publication
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Publication commands
   :END:
Once properly configured, Org can publish with the following commands:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-e X)}}}, ~org-publish~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e X
  
  Prompt for a specific project and publish all files that belong to it.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-e P)}}}, ~org-publish-current-project~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e P

  Publish the project containing the current file.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-e F)}}}, ~org-publish-current-file~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e F

  Publish only the current file.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-e E)}}}, ~org-publish-all~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-e E

  Publish every project.


#+vindex: org-publish-use-timestamps-flag

Org uses timestamps to track when a file has changed.  The above
functions normally only publish changed files.  You can override this
and force publishing of all files by giving a prefix argument to any
of the commands above, or by customizing the variable
~org-publish-use-timestamps-flag~.  This may be necessary in particular
if files include other files via ~#+SETUPFILE:~ or ~#+INCLUDE:~.

* Working with source code
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: Export, evaluate, and tangle code blocks
  :ALT_TITLE: Working With Source Code
  :END:
#+cindex: Schulte, Eric
#+cindex: Davison, Dan
#+cindex: source code, working with

Source code can be included in Org mode documents using a
{{{samp(src)}}} block, e.g.:

#+begin_example
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defun org-xor (a b)
        "Exclusive or."
        (if a (not b) b))
   #+END_SRC
#+end_example

Org mode provides a number of features for working with live source
code, including editing of code blocks in their native major-mode,
evaluation of code blocks, converting code blocks into source files
(known as "tangling" in literate programming), and exporting code
blocks and their results in several formats.  This functionality was
contributed by Eric Schulte and Dan Davison, and was originally named
Org-babel.

The following sections describe Org mode's code block handling facilities.

** Structure of code blocks
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Code block syntax described
   :END:
#+cindex: code block, structure
#+cindex: source code, block structure
#+cindex: #+NAME
#+cindex: #+BEGIN_SRC

Live code blocks can be specified with a {{{samp(src)}}} block or
inline.[fn:147] The structure of a {{{samp(src)}}} block is shown in
the following example:

#+begin_example
   ,#+NAME: <name>
   ,#+BEGIN_SRC <language> <switches> <header arguments>
     <body>
   ,#+END_SRC
#+end_example

The ~#+NAME:~ line is optional, and can be used to name the code
block.  Live code blocks require that a language be specified on the
~#+BEGIN_SRC~ line.  Switches and header arguments are optional.
#+cindex: source code, inline

Live code blocks can also be specified inline using the following
syntax:

#+begin_example
   src_<language>{<body>}
#+end_example

or

#+begin_example
   src_<language>[<header arguments>]{<body>}
#+end_example

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~<#+NAME: name>~ ::
  #+cindex: #+NAME

  This line associates a name with the code block.  This is similar to
  the ~#+TBLNAME: NAME~ lines that can be used to name tables in Org
  mode files.  Referencing the name of a code block makes it possible to
  evaluate the block from other places in the file, from other files, or
  from Org mode table formulas (see [[The spreadsheet]]).  Names are assumed
  to be unique and the behavior of Org mode when two or more blocks
  share the same name is undefined.

- ~<language>~ ::
  #+cindex: source code, language

  The language of the code in the block (see [[Languages]]).

- ~<switches>~ ::
  #+cindex: source code, switches

  Optional switches control code block export (see the discussion of
  switches in [[Literal examples]]).

- ~<header arguments>~ ::
  #+cindex: source code, header arguments

  Optional header arguments control many aspects of evaluation, export
  and tangling of code blocks (see [[Header arguments]]).  Header arguments
  can also be set on a per-buffer or per-subtree basis using properties.

- ~<body>~ ::

  Source code in the specified language.

** Editing source code
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Language major-mode editing
   :END:
#+cindex: code block, editing
#+cindex: source code, editing
#+kindex: C-c '

Use {{{kbd(C-c ')}}} to edit the current code block.  This brings up a
language major-mode edit buffer containing the body of the code block.
Saving this buffer will write the new contents back to the Org buffer.
Use {{{kbd(C-c ')}}} again to exit.

The ~org-src-mode~ minor mode will be active in the edit buffer.  The
following variables can be used to configure the behavior of the edit
buffer.  See also the customization group ~org-edit-structure~ for
further configuration options.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~org-src-lang-modes~ ::

  If an Emacs major-mode named ~<lang>-mode~ exists, where
  ~<lang>~ is the language named in the header line of the code block,
  then the edit buffer will be placed in that major-mode.  This variable
  can be used to map arbitrary language names to existing major modes.

- ~org-src-window-setup~ ::

  Controls the way Emacs windows are rearranged when the edit buffer is
  created.

- ~org-src-preserve-indentation~ ::

  This variable is especially useful for tangling languages such as
  Python, in which whitespace indentation in the output is meaningful.

- ~org-src-ask-before-returning-to-edit-buffer~ ::

  By default, Org will ask before returning to an open edit buffer.  Set this
  variable to nil to switch without asking.


To turn on native code fontification in the Org mode buffer, configure
the variable ~org-src-fontify-natively~.

** Exporting code blocks
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Export contents and/or results
   :END:
#+cindex: code block, exporting
#+cindex: source code, exporting

It is possible to export the /code/ of code blocks, the /results/ of
code block evaluation, /both/ the code and the results of code block
evaluation, or /none/.  For most languages, the default exports code.
However, for some languages (e.g., ~ditaa~) the default exports the
results of code block evaluation.  For information on exporting code
block bodies, see [[Literal examples]].

The ~:exports~ header argument can be used to specify export
behavior with the following arguments:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~:exports code~ ::

  The default in most languages.  The body of the code block is exported, as
  described in [[Literal examples]].

- ~:exports results~ ::

  The code block will be evaluated and the results will be placed in the
  Org mode buffer for export, either updating previous results of the
  code block located anywhere in the buffer or, if no previous results
  exist, placing the results immediately after the code block.  The body
  of the code block will not be exported.

- ~:exports both~ ::

  Both the code block and its results will be exported.

- ~:exports none~ ::

  Neither the code block nor its results will be exported.


It is possible to inhibit the evaluation of code blocks during export.
Setting the ~org-export-babel-evaluate~ variable to ~nil~ will ensure
that no code blocks are evaluated as part of the export process.  This
can be useful in situations where potentially untrusted Org mode files
are exported in an automated fashion, for example when Org mode is
used as the markup language for a wiki.

** Extracting source code
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Create pure source code files
   :END:
#+cindex: tangling
#+cindex: source code, extracting
#+cindex: code block, extracting source code

Creating pure source code files by extracting code from source blocks
is referred to as "tangling"---a term adopted from the literate
programming community.  During tangling of code blocks their bodies are
expanded using ~org-babel-expand-src-block~ which can expand both
variable and ``noweb'' style references (see [[Noweb reference syntax]]).

*** Header arguments for tangling
#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~:tangle no~ ::

  The default.  The code block is not included in the tangled output.

- ~:tangle yes~ ::

  Include the code block in the tangled output.  The output file name is
  the name of the org file with the extension {{{samp(.org)}}} replaced
  by the extension for the block language.

- ~:tangle filename~ ::

  Include the code block in the tangled output to file {{{samp(filename)}}}.

*** Functions for tangling
#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~org-babel-tangle~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-v t

  Tangle the current file.  Bound to {{{kbd(C-c C-v t)}}}.

  With a prefix argument only tangle the current code block.

- ~org-babel-tangle-file~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-v f

  Choose a file to tangle.  Bound to {{{kbd(C-c C-v f)}}}.

*** Hooks for tangling
#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~org-babel-post-tangle-hook~ ::

  This hook is run from within code files tangled by ~org-babel-tangle~.
  Example applications could include post-processing, compilation, or
  evaluation of tangled code files.

** Evaluating code blocks
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Place results in the Org buffer
   :END:
#+cindex: code block, evaluating
#+cindex: source code, evaluating
#+cindex: #+RESULTS

Code blocks can be evaluated and the results of evaluation optionally
placed in the Org mode buffer.[fn:148] The results of evaluation are
placed following a line that begins by default with ~#+RESULTS~ and
optionally a cache identifier and/or the name of the evaluated code
block.  The default value of ~#+RESULTS~ can be changed with the
customizable variable ~org-babel-results-keyword~.

By default, the evaluation facility is only enabled for Lisp code
blocks specified as ~emacs-lisp~.  However, source code blocks in many
languages can be evaluated within Org mode (see [[Languages]] for a list
of supported languages and [[Structure of code blocks]] for information on
the syntax used to define a code block).

#+kindex: C-c C-c
#+kindex: C-c C-v e

There are a number of ways to evaluate code blocks.  The simplest is to
press {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} or {{{kbd(C-c C-v e)}}} with the point on a
code block.[fn:149] This will call the ~org-babel-execute-src-block~
function to evaluate the block and insert its results into the Org
mode buffer.

#+cindex: #+CALL

It is also possible to evaluate named code blocks from anywhere in an
Org mode buffer or an Org mode table.  Live code blocks located in the
current Org mode buffer or in the ``Library of Babel'' (see [[Library of
Babel]]) can be executed.  Named code blocks can be executed with a
separate ~#+CALL:~ line or inline within a block of text.

The syntax of the ~#+CALL:~ line is:

#+begin_example
   ,#+CALL: <name>(<arguments>)
   ,#+CALL: <name>[<inside header arguments>](<arguments>) <end header arguments>
#+end_example

The syntax for inline evaluation of named code blocks is:

#+begin_example
   ... call_<name>(<arguments>) ...
   ... call_<name>[<inside header arguments>](<arguments>)[<end header arguments>] ...
#+end_example

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~<name>~ ::

  The name of the code block to be evaluated (see [[Structure of code
  blocks]]).

- ~<arguments>~ ::

  Arguments specified in this section will be passed to the code block.
  These arguments use standard function call syntax, rather than header
  argument syntax.  For example, a ~#+CALL:~ line that passes the number
  four to a code block named ~double~, which declares the header
  argument ~:var n=2~, would be written as ~#+CALL: double(n=4)~.

- ~<inside header arguments>~ ::

  Inside header arguments are passed through and applied to the named
  code block.  These arguments use header argument syntax rather than
  standard function call syntax.  Inside header arguments affect how the
  code block is evaluated.  For example, ~[:results output]~ will collect
  the results of everything printed to ~STDOUT~ during execution of the
  code block.

- ~<end header arguments>~ ::

  End header arguments are applied to the calling instance and do not
  affect evaluation of the named code block.  They affect how the results
  are incorporated into the Org mode buffer and how the call line is
  exported.  For example, ~:results html~ will insert the results of the
  call line evaluation in the Org buffer, wrapped in a ~BEGIN_HTML:~
  block.


For more examples of passing header arguments to ~#+CALL:~ lines see
[[Header arguments in function calls]].

** Library of Babel
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Use and contribute to a source code library
   :END:
#+cindex: babel, library of
#+cindex: source code, library
#+cindex: code block, library

The ``Library of Babel'' consists of code blocks that can be called
from any Org mode file.  Code blocks defined in the ``Library of
Babel'' can be called remotely as if they were in the current Org mode
buffer (see [[Evaluating code blocks]] for information on the syntax of
remote code block evaluation).


The central repository of code blocks in the ``Library of Babel'' is
housed in an Org mode file located in the {{{samp(contrib)}}}
directory of Org mode.

Users can add code blocks they believe to be generally useful to their
``Library of Babel.'' The code blocks can be stored in any Org mode
file and then loaded into the library with ~org-babel-lob-ingest~.

#+kindex: C-c C-v i

Code blocks located in any Org mode file can be loaded into the
``Library of Babel'' with the ~org-babel-lob-ingest~ function, bound
to {{{kbd(C-c C-v i)}}}.

Language-specific documentation is available for some languages.  If
available, it can be found at
[[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages.html]].

The variable ~org-babel-load-languages~ controls which languages are
enabled for evaluation (by default only ~emacs-lisp~ is enabled).  This
variable can be set using the customization interface or by adding
code like the following example, disables ~emacs-lisp~ evaluation and
enables evaluation of ~R~ code blocks, to your emacs configuration:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-babel-do-load-languages
 'org-babel-load-languages
 '((emacs-lisp . nil)
   (R . t)))
#+end_src

It is also possible to enable support for a language by loading the
related elisp file with ~require~.

{{{noindent}}} The following example adds support for evaluating
~clojure~ code blocks:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'ob-clojure)
#+end_src

the ~org-babel-default-header-args~ variable:

#+begin_example
   :session    => "none"
   :results    => "replace"
   :exports    => "code"
   :cache      => "no"
   :noweb      => "no"
#+end_example

# #+begin_example
#   org-babel-default-header-args is a variable defined in `org-babel.el'.
#   Its value is
#   ((:session . "none")
#    (:results . "replace")
#    (:exports . "code")
#    (:cache . "no")
#    (:noweb . "no"))


#   Documentation:
#   Default arguments to use when evaluating a code block.
# #+end_example

For example, the following code could be used to set the default
value of ~:noweb~ header arguments to ~yes~.  This would have the
effect of expanding ~:noweb~ references by default when evaluating
source code blocks.

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-babel-default-header-args
        (cons '(:noweb . "yes")
              (assq-delete-all :noweb org-babel-default-header-args)))
#+end_src

**** Language-specific header arguments
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Set default values by language
     :END:

Each language can define its own set of default header arguments.  See
the language-specific documentation available online at
[[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel]].

**** Buffer-wide header arguments
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Set default values for a specific buffer
     :END:

Buffer-wide header arguments may be specified as properties through
the use of ~#+PROPERTY:~ lines placed anywhere in an Org mode file
(see [[Property syntax]]).

For example the following would set ~session~ to ~*R*~, and ~results~
to ~silent~ for every code block in the buffer, ensuring that all
execution took place in the same session, and no results would be
inserted into the buffer.

#+begin_example
   ,#+PROPERTY: session *R*
   ,#+PROPERTY: results silent
#+end_example

**** Header arguments in Org mode properties
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Set default values for a buffer or heading
     :END:

Header arguments are also read from Org mode properties (see [[Property
syntax]]), which can be set on a buffer-wide or per-heading basis.  An
example of setting a header argument for all code blocks in a buffer
is as follows:

#+begin_example
   ,#+PROPERTY: tangle yes
#+end_example

#+vindex: org-use-property-inheritance

When properties are used to set default header arguments, they are
looked up with inheritance, regardless of the value of
~org-use-property-inheritance~.  In the following example the value of
the ~:cache~ header argument will default to ~yes~ in all code blocks
in the subtree rooted at the following heading:

#+begin_example
   ,* outline header
   ,:PROPERTIES:
   ,:cache:    yes
   ,:END:
#+end_example

#+kindex: C-c C-x p
#+vindex: org-babel-default-header-args

Properties defined in this way override the properties set in
~org-babel-default-header-args~.  It is convenient to use the
~org-set-property~ function bound to {{{kbd(C-c C-x p)}}} to set
properties in Org mode documents.

**** Code block specific header arguments
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: The most common way to set values
     :END:

The most common way to assign values to header arguments is at the
code block level.  This can be done by listing a sequence of header
arguments and their values as part of the ~#+BEGIN_SRC~ line.
Properties set in this way override both the values of
~org-babel-default-header-args~ and header arguments specified as
properties.  In the following example, the ~:results~ header argument
is set to ~silent~, meaning the results of execution will not be
inserted in the buffer, and the ~:exports~ header argument is set to
~code~, meaning only the body of the code block will be preserved on
export to HTML or LaTeX.

#+begin_example
   #+NAME: factorial
   #+BEGIN_SRC haskell :results silent :exports code :var n=0
   fac 0 = 1
   fac n = n * fac (n-1)
   #+END_SRC
#+end_example

Similarly, it is possible to set header arguments for inline code blocks:

#+begin_example
   src_haskell[:exports both]@{fac 5@}
#+end_example

Code block header arguments can span multiple lines using ~#+HEADER:~
or ~#+HEADERS:~ lines preceding a code block or nested between the
~#+NAME:~ line and the ~#+BEGIN_SRC~ line of a named code block.

#+cindex: #+HEADER:
#+cindex: #+HEADERS:

This is an example of multi-line header arguments on an un-named code
block:

#+begin_example
   ,#+HEADERS: :var data1=1
   ,#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var data2=2
      (message "data1:%S, data2:%S" data1 data2)
   ,#+END_SRC

   ,#+RESULTS:
   : data1:1, data2:2
#+end_example

This is an example of multi-line header arguments on a named code block:

#+begin_example
   ,#+NAME: named-block
   ,#+HEADER: :var data=2
   ,#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (message "data:%S" data)
   ,#+END_SRC

   ,#+RESULTS: named-block
    : data:2
#+end_example

**** Header arguments in function calls
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: The most specific level
     :END:

At the most specific level, header arguments for ``Library of Babel''
or ~#+CALL:~ lines can be set as shown in the two examples below.  For
more information on the structure of ~#+CALL:~ lines see [[Evaluating
code blocks]].

The following example will apply the ~:exports results~ header
argument to the evaluation of the ~#+CALL:~ line:

#+begin_example
   ,#+CALL: factorial(n=5) :exports results
#+end_example

The following example will apply the ~:session special~ header
argument to the evaluation of the ~factorial~ code block:

#+begin_example
   ,#+CALL: factorial[:session special](n=5)
#+end_example

*** Specific header arguments
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: List of header arguments
    :END:
Header arguments consist of an initial colon followed by the name of
the argument in lowercase letters.  Additional header arguments are
defined on a language-specific basis, see [[Languages]].

The following header arguments are defined:

**** var
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Pass arguments to code blocks
     :END:
The ~:var~ header argument is used to pass arguments to code blocks.
The specifics of how arguments are included in a code block vary by
language; these are addressed in the language-specific documentation.
However, the syntax used to specify arguments is the same across all
languages.  In every case, variables require a default value when they
are declared.

The values passed to arguments can either be literal values,
references, or Emacs Lisp code (see [[Emacs Lisp evaluation of
variables]]).  References include anything in the Org mode file that
takes a ~#+NAME:~, ~#+TBLNAME:~, or ~#+RESULTS:~ line.  This includes
tables, lists, ~#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE~ blocks, other code blocks, and the
results of other code blocks.

Argument values can be indexed in a manner similar to arrays (see
[[Indexable variable values]]).

The following syntax is used to pass arguments to code blocks using the
~:var~ header argument:

#+begin_example
   :var name=assign
#+end_example

The argument, ~assign~, can either be a literal value, such as a
string {{{samp("string")}}} or a number {{{samp(9)}}}, or a reference
to a table, a list, a literal example, another code block (with or
without arguments), or the results of evaluating another code block.

Here are examples of passing values by reference:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- a table named with either ~#+NAME:~ or ~#+TBLNAME:~ ::

  #+begin_example
     #+TBLNAME: example-table
     | 1 |
     | 2 |
     | 3 |
     | 4 |

     #+NAME: table-length
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var table=example-table
     (length table)
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS: table-length
     : 4
  #+end_example

- a simple list named with ~#+NAME:~ :: 

  #+begin_example
     #+NAME: example-list
       - simple
         - not
         - nested
       - list

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var x=example-list
       (print x)
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS:
     | simple | list |
  #+end_example

  Note that nesting is not carried through to the source code block.

- a named code block without arguments, optionally followed by parentheses ::

  #+begin_example
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var length=table-length()
     (* 2 length)
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS:
     : 8
  #+end_example

- a named code block with arguments ::

  #+begin_example
     #+NAME: double
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var input=8
     (* 2 input)
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS: double
     : 16

     #+NAME: squared
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var input=double(input=1)
     (* input input)
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS: squared
     : 4
  #+end_example

- a literal example block ::

  #+begin_example
     ,#+NAME: literal-example
     ,#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     A literal example
     on two lines
     ,#+END_EXAMPLE

     ,#+NAME: read-literal-example
     ,#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var x=literal-example
       (concatenate 'string x " for you.")
     ,#+END_SRC

     ,#+RESULTS: read-literal-example
      : A literal example
      : on two lines for you.
  #+end_example

# ***** Alternate argument syntax
<<Alternate argument syntax>>

It is also possible to specify arguments in a potentially more natural
way using the ~#+NAME:~ line of a code block.  As in the following
example, arguments can be packed inside of parentheses, separated by
commas, following the source name.

#+begin_example
   ,#+NAME: double(input=0, x=2)
   ,#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (* 2 (+ input x))
   ,#+END_SRC
#+end_example

# ***** Indexable variable values
<<Indexable variable values>>

It is possible to reference portions of variable values by
/indexing/ into the variables.  Indexes are 0 based with negative
values counting back from the end.  If an index is separated by commas
then each subsequent section will index into the next deepest nesting
or dimension of the value.  Note that this indexing occurs /before/
other table related header arguments like ~:hlines~, ~:colnames~, and
~:rownames~ are applied.  The following example assigns the last cell
of the first row the table ~example-table~ to the variable ~data~:

#+begin_example
   ,#+NAME: example-table
   | 1 | a |
   | 2 | b |
   | 3 | c |
   | 4 | d |

   ,#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var data=example-table[0,-1]
     data
   ,#+END_SRC

   ,#+RESULTS:
   : a
#+end_example

Ranges of variable values can be referenced using two integers
separated by a ~:~, in which case the entire inclusive range is
referenced.  The following example assigns the middle three rows of
~example-table~ to ~data~.

#+begin_example
   #+NAME: example-table
   | 1 | a |
   | 2 | b |
   | 3 | c |
   | 4 | d |
   | 5 | 3 |

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var data=example-table[1:3]
     data
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   | 2 | b |
   | 3 | c |
   | 4 | d |
#+end_example

Additionally, an empty index, or the single character ~*~, are both
interpreted to mean the entire range and as such are equivalent to
~0:-1~, as shown in the following example in which the entire first
column is referenced:

#+begin_example
   #+NAME: example-table
   | 1 | a |
   | 2 | b |
   | 3 | c |
   | 4 | d |

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var data=example-table[,0]
     data
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
#+end_example

It is possible to index into the results of code blocks as well as
tables.  Any number of dimensions can be indexed.  Dimensions are
separated from one another by commas, as shown in the following
example:

#+begin_example
   #+NAME: 3D
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     '(((1  2  3)  (4  5  6)  (7  8  9))
       ((10 11 12) (13 14 15) (16 17 18))
       ((19 20 21) (22 23 24) (25 26 27)))
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var data=3D[1,,1]
     data
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   | 11 | 14 | 17 |
#+end_example

# ***** Emacs Lisp evaluation of variables
<<Emacs Lisp evaluation of variables>>

Emacs lisp code can be used to initialize variable values.  When a
variable value starts with ~(~, ~[~, ~'~ or ~`~ it will be evaluated
as Emacs Lisp and the result of the evaluation will be assigned as the
variable value.  The following example demonstrates use of this
evaluation to reliably pass the file-name of the Org mode buffer to a
code block:[fn:150]

#+begin_example
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh :var filename=(buffer-file-name) :exports both
     wc -w $filename
   #+END_SRC
#+end_example

Note that values read from tables and lists will not be evaluated as
Emacs Lisp, as shown in the following example, which contains a Lisp
list as the sole table element:

#+begin_example
   #+NAME: table
   | (a b c) |

   #+HEADERS: :var data=table[0,0]
   #+BEGIN_SRC perl
     $data
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   : (a b c)
#+end_example

**** results
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Specify the type of results and how they will be collected and handled
     :END:
There are three classes of ~:results~ header argument.  Only one option
per class may be supplied per code block.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- Collection ::

  These header arguments specify how the results should be collected
  from the code block.

- Type ::

  These header arguments specify what type of result the code block will
  return---which has implications for how they will be inserted into the
  Org mode buffer.

- Handling ::

  These header arguments specify how the results of evaluating the code
  block should be handled.

# ***** Collection
<<Collection>>

The following ~:results~ options are mutually exclusive, and specify
how the results should be collected from the code block.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~value~ ::

  This is the default.  The result is the value of the last statement in
  the code block.  This header argument places the evaluation in
  functional mode.  Note that in some languages, e.g., Python, use of
  this result type requires that a ~return~ statement be included in the
  body of the source code block.

- ~output~ ::

  The result is the collection of everything printed to STDOUT during
  the execution of the code block.  This header argument places the
  evaluation in scripting mode.

# ***** Type
<<Type>>

The following ~:results~ options are mutually exclusive and specify
what type of results the code block will return.  By default, results
are inserted as either a table or scalar depending on their value.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~table~, ~vector~ ::

  The results should be interpreted as an Org mode table.  If a single
  value is returned, it will be converted into a table with one row and
  one column.  E.g., ~:results value table~.

- ~scalar~, ~verbatim~ ::

  The results should be interpreted literally---they will not be
  converted into a table.  The results will be inserted into the Org mode
  buffer as quoted text.  E.g., ~:results value verbatim~.

- ~list~ ::

  The results should be interpreted as an Org mode list.  If a single
  scalar value is returned it will be converted into a list with only
  one element.

- ~file~ ::

  The results will be interpreted as the path to a file, and will be
  inserted into the Org mode buffer as a file link.  E.g., ~:results
  value file~.

- ~raw~ ::

  The results are interpreted as raw Org mode code and are inserted
  directly into the buffer.  If the results look like a table they will
  be aligned as such by Org mode.  E.g., ~:results value raw~.

- ~org~ ::

  The results are will be enclosed in a ~BEGIN_SRC org~ block.  They are
  not comma-escaped by default but they will be if you hit
  {{{kbd(TAB)}}} in the block and/or if you export the file.  E.g.,
  ~:results value org~.

- ~html~ ::

  Results are assumed to be HTML and will be enclosed in a ~BEGIN_HTML~
  block.  E.g., ~:results value html~.

- ~latex~ ::

  Results assumed to be LaTeX and are enclosed in a ~BEGIN_LaTeX~
  block.  E.g., ~:results value latex~.

- ~code~ ::

  Result are assumed to be parsable code and are enclosed in a code
  block.  E.g., ~:results value code~.

- ~pp~ ::

  The result is converted to pretty-printed code and is enclosed in a
  code block.  This option currently supports Emacs Lisp, Python, and
  Ruby.  E.g., ~:results value pp~.

- ~drawer~ ::

  The result is wrapped in a RESULTS drawer.  This can be useful for
  inserting ~raw~ or ~org~ syntax results in such a way that their
  extent is known and they can be automatically removed or replaced.

# ***** Handling
<<Handling>>
The following ~:results~ options indicate what happens with the
results once they are collected.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~replace~ ::

  The default value.  Any existing results will be removed, and the new
  results will be inserted into the Org mode buffer in their place.
  E.g., ~:results output replace~.

- ~append~ ::

  If there are pre-existing results of the code block then the new
  results will be appended to the existing results.  Otherwise the new
  results will be inserted as with ~replace~.

- ~prepend~ ::

  If there are pre-existing results of the code block then the new
  results will be prepended to the existing results.  Otherwise the new
  results will be inserted as with ~replace~.

- ~silent~ ::

  The results will be echoed in the minibuffer but will not be inserted
  into the Org mode buffer.  E.g., ~:results output silent~.

**** file
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Specify a path for file output
     :END:

The header argument ~:file~ is used to specify an external file in
which to save code block results.  After code block evaluation an Org
mode style ~[[file:]]~ link (see [[Link format]]) to the file will be inserted
into the Org mode buffer.  Some languages including R, gnuplot, dot,
and ditaa provide special handling of the ~:file~ header argument,
automatically wrapping the code block body in the boilerplate code
required to save output to the specified file.  This is often useful
for saving graphical output of a code block to the specified file.

The argument to ~:file~ should be either a string specifying the path
to a file, or a list of two strings in which case the first element of
the list should be the path to a file and the second a description for
the link.

**** file-desc
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Specify a description for file results
     :END:

The value of the ~:file-desc~ header argument is used to provide a
description for file code block results which are inserted as Org mode
links (see [[Link format]]).  If the ~:file-desc~ header argument is given
with no value the link path will be placed in both the ``link'' and
the ``description'' portion of the Org mode link.

**** dir
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Specify the default (possibly remote) directory for code block execution
     :TITLE:    ~:dir~ and remote execution
     :END:

While the ~:file~ header argument can be used to specify the path to
the output file, ~:dir~ specifies the default directory during code
block execution.  If it is absent, then the directory associated with
the current buffer is used.  In other words, supplying ~:dir path~
temporarily has the same effect as changing the current directory with
{{{kbd(M-x cd path)}}}, and then not supplying ~:dir~.  Under the
surface, ~:dir~ simply sets the value of the Emacs variable
~default-directory~.

When using ~:dir~, you should supply a relative path for file output
(e.g., ~:file myfile.jpg~ or ~:file results/myfile.jpg~) in which
case that path will be interpreted relative to the default directory.

In other words, if you want your plot to go into a folder called
{{{file(Work)}}} in your home directory, you could use a code block
like the following example:

#+begin_example
   #+BEGIN_SRC R :file myplot.png :dir ~/Work
   matplot(matrix(rnorm(100), 10), type="l")
   #+END_SRC
#+end_example

# ***** Remote execution
<<Remote execution>>

A directory on a remote machine can be specified using tramp file
syntax, in which case the code will be evaluated on the remote
machine.  An example is:

#+begin_example
   #+BEGIN_SRC R :file plot.png :dir /dand@yakuba.princeton.edu:
   plot(1:10, main=system("hostname", intern=TRUE))
   #+END_SRC
#+end_example

Text results will be returned to the local Org mode buffer as usual,
and file output will be created on the remote machine with relative
paths interpreted relative to the remote directory.  An Org mode link
to the remote file will be created.

So, in the above example a plot will be created on the remote machine,
and a link of the following form will be inserted in the org buffer:

#+begin_example
   [[file:/scp:dand@yakuba.princeton.edu:/home/dand/plot.png][plot.png]]
#+end_example

Most of this functionality follows immediately from the fact that
~:dir~ sets the value of the Emacs variable ~default-directory~,
thanks to tramp.  Those using XEmacs, or GNU Emacs prior to version 23
may need to install tramp separately in order for these features to
work correctly.

# ***** Further points
<<Further points>>
Please be aware of these further points:

- If ~:dir~ is used in conjunction with ~:session~, although it will
  determine the starting directory for a new session as expected, no
  attempt is currently made to alter the directory associated with an
  existing session.

- ~:dir~ should typically not be used to create files during export
  with ~:exports results~ or ~:exports both~.  The reason is that, in
  order to retain portability of exported material between machines,
  during export links inserted into the buffer will /not/ be expanded
  against ~default directory~.  Therefore, if ~default-directory~ is
  altered using ~:dir~, it is probable that the file will be created
  in a location to which the link does not point.

**** exports
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Export code and/or results
     :END:
The ~:exports~ header argument specifies what should be included in HTML
or LaTeX exports of the Org mode file.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~code~ ::

  The default.  The body of code is included into the exported file.
  E.g., ~:exports code~.

- ~results~ ::

  The result of evaluating the code is included in the exported file.
  E.g., ~:exports results~.

- ~both~ ::

  Both the code and results are included in the exported file.  E.g.,
  ~:exports both~.

- ~none~ ::

  Nothing is included in the exported file.  E.g., ~:exports none~.

**** tangle
     :PROPERTIES:
     :DESCRIPTION: Toggle tangling and specify file name
     :END:

The ~:tangle~ header argument specifies whether or not the code
block should be included in tangled extraction of source code files.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~tangle~ ::

  The code block is exported to a source code file named after the full
  path (including the directory) and file name (w/o extension) of the
  Org mode file.  E.g., ~:tangle yes~.

- ~no~ ::

  The default.  The code block is not exported to a source code file.
  E.g., ~:tangle no~.

- other ::

  Any other string passed to the ~:tangle~ header argument is
  interpreted as a path (directory and file name relative to the
  directory of the Org mode file) to which the block will be exported,
  e.g., ~:tangle path~.

**** mkdirp
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Toggle creation of parent directories of target files during tangling
:END:

The ~:mkdirp~ header argument can be used to create parent directories
of tangled files when missing.  This can be set to ~yes~ to enable
directory creation or to ~no~ to inhibit directory creation.

**** comments
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Toggle insertion of comments in tangled code files
:END:

By default code blocks are tangled to source-code files without any
insertion of comments beyond those which may already exist in the body
of the code block.  The ~:comments~ header argument can be set as
follows to control the insertion of extra comments into the tangled
code file.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~no~ ::

  The default.  No extra comments are inserted during tangling.

- ~link~ ::

  The code block is wrapped in comments which contain pointers back to
  the original Org file from which the code was tangled.

- ~yes~ ::

  A synonym for ``link'' to maintain backwards compatibility.

- ~org~ ::

  Include text from the Org mode file as a comment.

  The text is picked from the leading context of the tangled code and is
  limited by the nearest headline or source block as the case may be.

- ~both~ ::

  Turns on both the ``link'' and ``org'' comment options.

- ~noweb~ ::

  Turns on the ``link'' comment option, and additionally wraps expanded
  noweb references in the code block body in link comments.

**** padline
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Control insertion of padding lines in tangle code files
:END:

Control in insertion of padding lines around code block bodies in tangled
code files.  The default value is ~yes~ which results in insertion of
newlines before and after each tangled code block.  The following arguments
are accepted:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~yes~ ::

  Insert newlines before and after each code block body in tangled code
  files.

- ~no~ ::

  Do not insert any newline padding in tangled output.

**** no-expand
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Turn off variable assignment and noweb expansion during tangling
:END:

By default, code blocks are expanded with ~org-babel-expand-src-block~
during tangling.  This has the effect of assigning values to variables
specified with ~:var~ (see [[var]]), and of replacing ``noweb'' references
(see [[Noweb reference syntax]]) with their targets.  The ~:no-expand~
header argument can be used to turn off this behavior.

**** session
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Preserve state of code evaluation
:END:

The ~:session~ header argument starts a session for an interpreted
language where state is preserved.

By default, a session is not started.

A string passed to the ~:session~ header argument will give the
session a name.  This makes it possible to run concurrent sessions for
each interpreted language.

**** noweb
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Toggle expansion of noweb references
:END:

The ~:noweb~ header argument controls expansion of ``noweb'' syntax
references (see [[Noweb reference syntax]]) when the code block is
evaluated, tangled, or exported.  The ~:noweb~ header argument can have
one of the five values: ~no~, ~yes~, ~tangle~, ~no-export~, or
~strip-export~.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~no~ ::

  The default.  ``Noweb'' syntax references in the body of the code block
  will not be expanded before the code block is evaluated, tangled or
  exported.

- ~yes~ ::

  ``Noweb'' syntax references in the body of the code block will be
  expanded before the code block is evaluated, tangled or exported.

- ~tangle~ ::

  ``Noweb'' syntax references in the body of the code block will be
  expanded before the code block is tangled.  However, ``noweb'' syntax
  references will not be expanded when the code block is evaluated or
  exported.

- ~no-export~ ::

  ``Noweb'' syntax references in the body of the code block will be
  expanded before the block is evaluated or tangled.  However, ``noweb''
  syntax references will not be expanded when the code block is
  exported.

- ~strip-export~ ::

  ``Noweb'' syntax references in the body of the code block will be
  expanded before the block is evaluated or tangled.  However, ``noweb''
  syntax references will not be removed when the code block is exported.

- ~eval~ ::

  ``Noweb'' syntax references in the body of the code block will only be
  expanded before the block is evaluated.

# ***** Noweb prefix lines
<<Noweb prefix lines>>

Noweb insertions are placed behind the line prefix of the
~<<reference>>~.  Because the ~<<example>>~ noweb reference appears
behind the SQL comment syntax in the following example, each line of
the expanded noweb reference will be commented.

This code block:

#+begin_example
   -- <<example>>
#+end_example


expands to:

#+begin_example
   -- this is the
   -- multi-line body of example
#+end_example

Note that noweb replacement text that does not contain any newlines
will not be inserted behind the line prefix, so it is always possible
to use inline noweb references.

**** noweb-ref
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Specify block's noweb reference resolution target
:END:

When expanding ``noweb'' style references the bodies of all code block
with /either/ a block name matching the reference name /or/ a
~:noweb-ref~ header argument matching the reference name will be
concatenated together to form the replacement text.

By setting this header argument at the sub-tree or file level, simple code
block concatenation may be achieved.  For example, when tangling the
following Org mode file, the bodies of code blocks will be concatenated into
the resulting pure code file.[fn:151]

#+begin_example
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle yes :noweb yes :shebang #!/bin/sh
     <<fullest-disk>>
   #+END_SRC
  ,* the mount point of the fullest disk
     :PROPERTIES:
     :noweb-ref: fullest-disk
     :END:

   ,** query all mounted disks
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     df \
   #+END_SRC

   ,** strip the header row
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     |sed '1d' \
   #+END_SRC

   ,** sort by the percent full
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     |awk '@{print $5 " " $6@}'|sort -n |tail -1 \
   #+END_SRC

   ,** extract the mount point
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     |awk '@{print $2@}'
   #+END_SRC
#+end_example

The ~:noweb-sep~ (see [[noweb-sep]]) header argument holds the string used
to separate accumulate noweb references like those above.  By default a
newline is used.

**** noweb-sep
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: String used to separate noweb references
:END:

The ~:noweb-sep~ header argument holds the string used to separate
accumulated noweb references (see [[noweb-ref]]).  By default a newline is
used.

**** cache
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Avoid re-evaluating unchanged code blocks
:END:

The ~:cache~ header argument controls the use of in-buffer caching of
the results of evaluating code blocks.  It can be used to avoid
re-evaluating unchanged code blocks.  Note that the ~:cache~ header
argument will not attempt to cache results when the ~:session~ header
argument is used, because the results of the code block execution may
be stored in the session outside of the Org mode buffer.  The ~:cache~
header argument can have one of two values: ~yes~ or ~no~.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~no~ ::

  The default.  No caching takes place, and the code block will be
  evaluated every time it is called.

- ~yes~ ::

  Every time the code block is run a SHA1 hash of the code and arguments
  passed to the block will be generated.  This hash is packed into the
  ~#+RESULTS:~ line and will be checked on subsequent executions of the
  code block.  If the code block has not changed since the last time it
  was evaluated, it will not be re-evaluated.


Code block caches notice if the value of a variable argument
to the code block has changed.  If this is the case, the cache is
invalidated and the code block is re-run.  In the following example,
~caller~ will not be re-run unless the results of ~random~ have
changed since it was last run.

#+begin_example
   #+NAME: random
   #+BEGIN_SRC R :cache yes
   runif(1)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS[a2a72cd647ad44515fab62e144796432793d68e1]: random
   0.4659510825295

   #+NAME: caller
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var x=random :cache yes
   x
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS[bec9c8724e397d5df3b696502df3ed7892fc4f5f]: caller
   0.254227238707244
#+end_example

**** sep
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Delimiter for writing tabular results outside Org
:END:
#+kindex: C-c C-o

The ~:sep~ header argument can be used to control the delimiter used
when writing tabular results out to files external to Org mode.  This
is used either when opening tabular results of a code block by calling
the ~org-open-at-point~ function bound to {{{kbd(C-c C-o)}}} on the
code block, or when writing code block results to an external file
(see [[file]]) header argument.

By default, when ~:sep~ is not specified output tables are tab
delimited.

**** hlines
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Handle horizontal lines in tables
:END:

Tables are frequently represented with one or more horizontal lines,
or hlines.  The ~:hlines~ argument to a code block accepts the values
~yes~ or ~no~, with a default value of ~no~.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~no~ ::

  Strips horizontal lines from the input table.  In most languages this
  is the desired effect because an ~hline~ symbol is interpreted as an
  unbound variable and raises an error.  Setting ~:hlines no~ or relying
  on the default value yields the following results.

  #+begin_example
     #+TBLNAME: many-cols
     | a | b | c |
     |---+---+---|
     | d | e | f |
     |---+---+---|
     | g | h | i |

     #+NAME: echo-table
     #+BEGIN_SRC python :var tab=many-cols
       return tab
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS: echo-table
     | a | b | c |
     | d | e | f |
     | g | h | i |
  #+end_example

- ~yes~ ::

  Leaves hlines in the table.  Setting ~:hlines yes~ has this effect.

  #+begin_example
     #+TBLNAME: many-cols
     | a | b | c |
     |---+---+---|
     | d | e | f |
     |---+---+---|
     | g | h | i |

     #+NAME: echo-table
     #+BEGIN_SRC python :var tab=many-cols :hlines yes
       return tab
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS: echo-table
     | a | b | c |
     |---+---+---|
     | d | e | f |
     |---+---+---|
     | g | h | i |
  #+end_example

**** colnames
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Handle column names in tables
:END:

The ~:colnames~ header argument accepts the values ~yes~, ~no~, or
~nil~ for unassigned.  The default value is ~nil~.  Note that the
behavior of the ~:colnames~ header argument may differ across
languages.  For example Emacs Lisp code blocks ignore the ~:colnames~
header argument entirely given the ease with which tables with column
names may be handled directly in Emacs Lisp.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~nil~ ::

  If an input table looks like it has column names (because its second
  row is an hline), then the column names will be removed from the table
  before processing, then reapplied to the results.

  #+begin_example
     #+TBLNAME: less-cols
     | a |
     |---|
     | b |
     | c |

     #+NAME: echo-table-again
     #+BEGIN_SRC python :var tab=less-cols
       return [[val + '*' for val in row] for row in tab]
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS: echo-table-again
     | a  |
     |----|
     | b* |
     | c* |
  #+end_example

  Please note that column names are not removed before the table is
  indexed using variable indexing.  See [[Indexable variable values]].

- ~no~ ::

  No column name pre-processing takes place

- ~yes~ ::

  Column names are removed and reapplied as with ~nil~ even if the table
  does not ``look like'' it has column names (i.e., the second row is
  not an hline).

**** rownames
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Handle row names in tables
:END:

The ~:rownames~ header argument can take on the values ~yes~
or ~no~, with a default value of ~no~.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~no~ ::

  No row name pre-processing will take place.

- ~yes~ ::

  The first column of the table is removed from the table before
  processing, and is then reapplied to the results.

  #+begin_example
     #+TBLNAME: with-rownames
     | one | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |  5 |
     | two | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |

     #+NAME: echo-table-once-again
     #+BEGIN_SRC python :var tab=with-rownames :rownames yes
       return [[val + 10 for val in row] for row in tab]
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS: echo-table-once-again
     | one | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
     | two | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 |
  #+end_example

  Please note that row names are not removed before the table is indexed
  using variable indexing.  See [[Indexable variable values]].

**** shebang
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Make tangles files executable
:END:

Setting the ~:shebang~ header argument to a string value (e.g.,
{{{samp(:shebang "#!/bin/bash")}}}) causes the string to be inserted as the
first line of any tangled file holding the code block, and the file
permissions of the tangled file are set to make it executable.

**** eval
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Limit evaluation of specific code blocks
:END:

The ~:eval~ header argument can be used to limit the evaluation of
specific code blocks.  The ~:eval~ header argument can be useful for
protecting against the evaluation of dangerous code blocks or to
ensure that evaluation will require a query regardless of the value of
the ~org-confirm-babel-evaluate~ variable.  The possible values of
~:eval~ and their effects are shown below.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~never~ or ~no~ ::

  The code block will not be evaluated under any circumstances.

- ~query~ ::

  Evaluation of the code block will require an affirmative answer to a
  query.

- ~never-export~ or ~no-export~ ::

  The code block will not be evaluated during export but may still be
  called interactively.

- ~query-export~ ::

  Evaluation of the code block during export will require an affirmative
  answer to a query.


If this header argument is not set then evaluation is determined by the value
of the ~org-confirm-babel-evaluate~ variable (see [[Code evaluation
security]]).

**** wrap
:PROPERTIES:
:DESCRIPTION: Mark source block evaluation results
:END:

The ~:wrap~ header argument is used to mark the results of source
block evaluation.  The header argument can be passed a string that will
be appended to ~#+BEGIN_~ and ~#+END_~, which will then be used to
wrap the results.  If no string is specified then the results will be
wrapped in a ~#+BEGIN/END_RESULTS~ block.

** Results of evaluation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: How evaluation results are handled
   :END:
#+cindex: code block, results of evaluation
#+cindex: source code, results of evaluation

The way in which results are handled depends on whether a session is
invoked, as well as on whether ~:results value~ or ~:results output~
is used.  The following table shows the table possibilities.  For a full
listing of the possible results header arguments, see [[results]].

|                   | *Non-session*            | *Session*                           |
|-------------------+--------------------------+-------------------------------------|
| ~:results value~  | value of last expression | value of last expression            |
| ~:results output~ | contents of STDOUT       | concatenation of interpreter output |


Please note that with ~:results value~, the result in both ~:session~
and non-session is returned to Org mode as a table (a one- or
two-dimensional vector of strings or numbers) when appropriate.

*** Non-session

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~:results value~ ::

  This is the default.  Internally, the value is obtained by wrapping the
  code in a function definition in the external language, and evaluating
  that function.  Therefore, code should be written as if it were the
  body of such a function.  In particular, note that Python does not
  automatically return a value from a function unless a ~return~
  statement is present, and so a {{{samp(return)}}} statement will
  usually be required in Python.

  This is the only one of the four evaluation contexts in which the code
  is automatically wrapped in a function definition.

- ~:results output~ ::

  The code is passed to the interpreter as an external process, and the
  contents of the standard output stream are returned as text.[fn:152]

*** Session

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~:results value~ ::

  The code is passed to an interpreter running as an interactive Emacs
  inferior process.  Only languages which provide tools for interactive
  evaluation of code have session support, so some language (e.g., C and
  ditaa) do not support the ~:session~ header argument, and in other
  languages (e.g., Python and Haskell) which have limitations on the
  code which may be entered into interactive sessions, those limitations
  apply to the code in code blocks using the ~:session~ header argument
  as well.

  Unless the ~:results output~ option is supplied (see below) the result
  returned is the result of the last evaluation performed by the
  interpreter.[fn:153]

- ~:results output~ ::

  The code is passed to the interpreter running as an interactive Emacs
  inferior process.  The result returned is the concatenation of the
  sequence of (text) output from the interactive interpreter.  Notice
  that this is not necessarily the same as what would be sent to
  ~STDOUT~ if the same code were passed to a non-interactive interpreter
  running as an external process.  Compare the following two
  examples:

  #+begin_example
     #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
      print "hello"
      2
      print "bye"
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS:
     : hello
     : bye
  #+end_example

  In non-session mode, the `2' is not printed and does not appear.

  #+begin_example
     #+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session
      print "hello"
      2
      print "bye"
     #+END_SRC

     #+RESULTS:
     : hello
     : 2
     : bye
  #+end_example

  But in ~:session~ mode, the interactive interpreter receives input `2'
  and prints out its value, `2'.  (Indeed, the other print statements are
  unnecessary here).

** Noweb reference syntax
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Literate programming in Org mode
   :END:
#+cindex: code block, noweb reference
#+cindex: syntax, noweb
#+cindex: source code, noweb reference

The ``noweb'' (see [[http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/]]) Literate
Programming system allows named blocks of code to be referenced using
the familiar Noweb syntax:

#+begin_example
   <<code-block-name>>
#+end_example

When a code block is tangled or evaluated, whether or not ``noweb''
references are expanded depends upon the value of the ~:noweb~ header
argument.  If ~:noweb yes~, then a Noweb reference is expanded before
evaluation.  If ~:noweb no~, the default, then the reference is not
expanded before evaluation.  See the [[noweb-ref]] header argument for a
more flexible way to resolve noweb references.

It is possible to include the /results/ of a code block rather than
the body.  This is done by appending parenthesis to the code block
name, which may optionally contain arguments to the code block as
shown below.

#+begin_example
   <<code-block-name(optional arguments)>>
#+end_example

Note that the default value, ~:noweb no~, was chosen to ensure that
correct code is not broken in a language, such as Ruby, where
~<<arg>>~ is a syntactically valid construct.  If ~<<arg>>~ is not
syntactically valid in languages that you use, then please consider
setting the default value.

If noweb tangling is slow in large Org mode files, consider
setting the ~*org-babel-use-quick-and-dirty-noweb-expansion*~ variable
to true.  This will result in faster noweb reference resolution at the
expense of not correctly resolving inherited values of the
~:noweb-ref~ header argument.

Emacs would not be Emacs without completion, and Org mode uses it
whenever it makes sense.  If you prefer an iswitchb- or ido-like
interface for some of the completion prompts, you can specify your
preference by setting at most one of the variables
~org-completion-use-iswitchb~ or ~org-completion-use-ido~.

Org supports in-buffer completion.  This type of completion does not
make use of the minibuffer.  You simply type a few letters into the
buffer and use the {{{key(TAB)}}} key to complete text right there.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbdkey(M-,TAB)}}} ::
  #+kindex: M-@key{TAB}

  Complete word at point.

  - At the beginning of a headline :: 

    Complete TODO keywords.

  - After {{{kbd(XXX)}}} :: 
    # Should be \
    Complete TeX symbols supported by the exporter.

  - After {{{samp(*)}}} :: 

    Complete headlines in the current buffer so that they can be used in
    search links like:
    
    #+begin_example
       [[*find this headline]]
    #+end_example

  - After {{{samp(:)}}} in a headline :: 

    Complete tags.  The list of tags is taken from the variable
    ~org-tag-alist~ (possibly set through the {{{samp(#+TAGS)}}} in-buffer
    option, see [[Setting tags]]), or it is created dynamically from all tags
    used in the current buffer.

  - After {{{samp(:)}}} and not in a headline ::

    Complete property keys.  The list of keys is constructed dynamically
    from all keys used in the current buffer.

  - After {{{samp([)}}} ::

    Complete link abbreviations (see [[Link abbreviations]]).

  - After {{{samp(#+)}}} ::

    Complete the special keywords like {{{samp(TYP_TODO)}}} or
    {{{samp(OPTIONS)}}} which set file-specific options for Org mode.  When
    the option keyword is already complete, pressing {{{kbdkey(M-,TAB)}}}
    again will insert example settings for this keyword.

  - In the line after {{{samp(#+STARTUP: )}}} ::

    Complete startup keywords, i.e., valid keys for this line.

  - Elsewhere ::

    Complete dictionary words using Ispell.

** Easy templates
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Quick insertion of structural elements
   :END:
#+cindex: template insertion
#+cindex: insertion, of templates

Org mode supports insertion of empty structural elements (like
~#+BEGIN_SRC~ and ~#+END_SRC~ pairs) with just a few key strokes.  This
is achieved through a native template expansion mechanism.  Note that
Emacs has several other template mechanisms which could be used in a
similar way, for example {{{file(yasnippet)}}}.

To insert a structural element, type a {{{kbd(<)}}}, followed by a
template selector and {{{kbdkey(,TAB)}}}.  Completion takes effect only
when the above keystrokes are typed on a line by itself.

The following template selectors are currently supported:
#+kindex: s
#+kindex: e
#+kindex: q
#+kindex: v
#+kindex: c
#+kindex: l
#+kindex: L
#+kindex: h
#+kindex: H
#+kindex: a
#+kindex: A
#+kindex: i
#+kindex: I

#+attr_texinfo: :columns 0.2 0.7
| Selector     | Template                              |
|--------------+---------------------------------------|
| {{{kbd(a)}}} | ~#+BEGIN_ASCII~ ...~ #+END_ASCII~     |
| {{{kbd(A)}}} | ~#+ASCII:~                            |
| {{{kbd(c)}}} | ~#+BEGIN_CENTER~ ... ~#+END_CENTER~   |
| {{{kbd(C)}}} | ~#+BEGIN_COMMENT~ ... ~#+END_COMMENT~ |
| {{{kbd(e)}}} | ~#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE~ ... ~#+END_EXAMPLE~ |
| {{{kbd(h)}}} | ~#+BEGIN_HTML~ ... ~#+END_HTML~       |
| {{{kbd(H)}}} | ~#+HTML:~                             |
| {{{kbd(i)}}} | ~#+INDEX:~                            |
| {{{kbd(I)}}} | ~#+INCLUDE:~                          |
| {{{kbd(l)}}} | ~#+BEGIN_LaTeX~ ... ~#+END_LaTeX~     |
| {{{kbd(L)}}} | ~#+LaTeX:~                            |
| {{{kbd(q)}}} | ~#+BEGIN_QUOTE~ ... ~#+END_QUOTE~     |
| {{{kbd(s)}}} | ~#+BEGIN_SRC~ ... ~#+END_SRC~         |
| {{{kbd(v)}}} | ~#+BEGIN_VERSE~ ... ~#+END_VERSE~     |

For example, on an empty line, typing "<e" and then pressing TAB, will expand
into a complete EXAMPLE template.

You can install additional templates by customizing the variable
~org-structure-template-alist~.  See the docstring of the variable for
additional details.

** Speed keys
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Electric commands at the beginning of a headline
   :END:
#+cindex: speed keys
#+vindex: org-use-speed-commands
#+vindex: org-speed-commands-user

Single keys can be made to execute commands when the cursor is at the
beginning of a headline, i.e., before the first star.  Configure the
variable ~org-use-speed-commands~ to activate this feature.  There is a
pre-defined list of commands, and you can add more such commands using
the variable ~org-speed-commands-user~.  Speed keys do not only speed
up navigation and other commands, but they also provide an alternative
way to execute commands bound to keys that are not or not easily
available on a TTY, or on a small mobile device with a limited
keyboard.

To see which commands are available, activate the feature and press
{{{kbd(?)}}} with the cursor at the beginning of a headline.

** Code evaluation security
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Org mode files evaluate in-line code
   :TITLE:    Code evaluation and security issues
   :END:

Org provides tools to work with the code snippets, including
evaluating them.

Running code on your machine always comes with a security risk.  Badly
written or malicious code can be executed on purpose or by accident.
Org has default settings that will only evaluate source code if you
give explicit permission to do so, and as a casual user of these
features you should leave these precautions intact.

For people who regularly work with source code, the confirmation
prompts can become annoying, and you might want to turn them off.  This
can be done, but you must be aware of the risks that are involved.

Code evaluation can happen under the following circumstances:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- Source code blocks ::

  Source code blocks can be evaluated during export, or when pressing
  {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} in the block.  The most important thing to realize
  here is that Org mode files which contain code snippets are, in a
  certain sense, like executable files.  So you should accept them and
  load them into Emacs only from trusted sources---just like you would
  do with a program you install on your computer.

  Make sure you know what you are doing before customizing the variables
  that take off the default security brakes.

  - ~org-confirm-babel-evaluate~ ::

    When ~t~ (the default), the user is asked before every code block
    evaluation.  When ~nil~, the user is not asked.  When set to a function,
    it is called with two arguments (language and body of the code block)
    and should return ~t~ to ask and ~nil~ not to ask.

  For example, here is how to execute "ditaa" code (which is considered
  safe) without asking:

  #+header: :eval no
  #+header: :exports code
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my-org-confirm-babel-evaluate (lang body)
    (not (string= lang "ditaa")))  ; don't ask for ditaa
  (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate 'my-org-confirm-babel-evaluate)
  #+end_src

- Following ~shell~ and ~elisp~ links ::

  Org has two link types that can directly evaluate code (see [[External
  links]]).  These links can be problematic because the code to be
  evaluated is not visible.

  - ~org-confirm-shell-link-function~ ::
    
    Function to queries user about shell link execution.

  - ~org-confirm-elisp-link-function~ ::

    Function to query user for Emacs Lisp link execution.

- Formulas in tables ::

  Formulas in tables (see [[The spreadsheet]]) are code that is evaluated
  either by the /calc/ interpreter, or by the /Emacs Lisp/ interpreter.

** Customization
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Adapting Org to your taste
   :END:
#+cindex: customization
#+cindex: options, for customization
#+cindex: variables, for customization

There are more than 500 variables that can be used to customize Org.
For the sake of compactness of the manual, I am not describing the
variables here.  A structured overview of customization variables is
available with {{{kbd(M-x org-customize)}}}.  Or select ~Browse Org
Group~ from the ~Org->Customization~ menu.  Many settings can also be
activated on a per-file basis, by putting special lines into the
buffer (see [[In-buffer settings]]).

** In-buffer settings
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Overview of the #+KEYWORDS
   :TITLE:    Summary of in-buffer settings
   :END:
#+cindex: in-buffer settings
#+cindex: special keywords

Org mode uses special lines in the buffer to define settings on a
per-file basis.  These lines start with a {{{samp(#+)}}} followed by a
keyword, a colon, and then individual words defining a setting.
Several setting words can be in the same line, but you can also have
multiple lines for the keyword.  While these settings are described
throughout the manual, here is a summary.  After changing any of those
lines in the buffer, press {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} with the cursor still in
the line to activate the changes immediately.  Otherwise they become
effective only when the file is visited again in a new Emacs session.

#+vindex: org-archive-location
#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(#+ARCHIVE: %s_done)}}} ::

  This line sets the archive location for the agenda file.  It applies to
  all subsequent lines, until the next {{{samp(#+ARCHIVE)}}} line or the
  end of the file.  The first such line also applies to any entries
  before it.  The corresponding variable is ~org-archive-location~.

- {{{kbd(#+CATEGORY:)}}} ::

  This line sets the category for the agenda file.  The category applies
  to all subsequent lines, until the next {{{samp(#+CATEGORY)}}} line or
  the end of the file.  The first such line also applies to any entries
  before it.

- {{{kbd(#+COLUMNS: %25ITEM ...)}}} ::
  #+cindex: property, COLUMNS

  Set the default format for columns view.  This format applies when
  columns view is invoked in locations where no ~COLUMNS~ property
  applies.

- {{{kbd(#+CONSTANTS: name1=value1 ...)}}} ::
  #+vindex: org-table-formula-constants
  #+vindex: org-table-formula

  Set file-local values for constants to be used in table formulas.  This
  line sets the local variable ~org-table-formula-constants-local~.  The
  global version of this variable is ~org-table-formula-constants~.

- {{{kbd(#+FILETAGS: :tag1:tag2:tag3:)}}} ::

  Set tags that can be inherited by any entry in the file, including the
  top-level entries.

- {{{kbd(#+DRAWERS: NAME1 ...)}}} ::
  #+vindex: org-drawers

  Set the file-local set of additional drawers.  The corresponding global
  variable is ~org-drawers~.

- {{{kbd(#+LINK:  linkword replace)}}} ::
  #+vindex: org-link-abbrev-alist

  These lines (several are allowed) specify link abbreviations.  See
  [[Link abbreviations]].  The corresponding variable is ~org-link-abbrev-alist~.

- {{{kbd(#+PRIORITIES: highest lowest default)}}} ::
  #+vindex: org-highest-priority
  #+vindex: org-lowest-priority
  #+vindex: org-default-priority

  This line sets the limits and the default for the priorities.  All
  three must be either letters A-Z or numbers 0-9.  The highest priority
  must have a lower ASCII number than the lowest priority.

- {{{kbd(#+PROPERTY: Property_Name Value)}}} ::

  This line sets a default inheritance value for entries in the current
  buffer, most useful for specifying the allowed values of a property.

- {{{kbd(#+SETUPFILE: file)}}} ::
  #+cindex: #+SETUPFILE

  This line defines a file that holds more in-buffer setup.  Normally
  this is entirely ignored.  Only when the buffer is parsed for
  option-setting lines (i.e., when starting Org mode for a file, when
  pressing {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} in a settings line, or when exporting),
  then the contents of this file are parsed as if they had been included
  in the buffer.  In particular, the file can be any other Org mode file
  with internal setup.  You can visit the file the cursor is in the line
  with {{{kbd(C-c ')}}}.

- {{{kbd(#+STARTUP:)}}} ::
  #+cindex: #+STARTUP:

  This line sets options to be used at startup of Org mode, when an
  Org file is being visited.

  The first set of options deals with the initial visibility of the
  outline tree.  The corresponding variable for global default settings
  is ~org-startup-folded~, with a default value ~t~, which means
  ~overview~.

  #+vindex: org-startup-folded
  #+cindex: @code{overview}, STARTUP keyword
  #+cindex: @code{content}, STARTUP keyword
  #+cindex: @code{showall}, STARTUP keyword
  #+cindex: @code{showeverything}, STARTUP keyword

  #+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
  - ~overview~ ::         top-level headlines only
  - ~content~ ::         all headlines
  - ~showall~ ::         no folding of any entries
  - ~showeverything~ ::  show even drawer contents

  #+vindex: org-startup-indented
  #+cindex: @code{indent}, STARTUP keyword
  #+cindex: @code{noindent}, STARTUP keyword

  Dynamic virtual indentation is controlled by the variable
  ~org-startup-indented~.[fn:182]

  #+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
  - ~indent~ ::     start with ~org-indent-mode~ turned on
  - ~noindent~ ::   start with ~org-indent-mode~ turned off

  #+vindex: org-startup-align-all-tables

  Then there are options for aligning tables upon visiting a file.  This
  is useful in files containing narrowed table columns.  The corresponding
  variable is ~org-startup-align-all-tables~, with a default value
  ~nil~.

  #+cindex: @code{align}, STARTUP keyword
  #+cindex: @code{noalign}, STARTUP keyword

  #+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
  - ~align~ ::      align all tables
  - ~noalign~ ::    don't align tables on startup

  #+vindex: org-startup-with-inline-images

  When visiting a file, inline images can be automatically displayed.
  The corresponding variable is ~org-startup-with-inline-images~, with a
  default value ~nil~ to avoid delays when visiting a file.

  #+cindex: @code{inlineimages}, STARTUP keyword
  #+cindex: @code{noinlineimages}, STARTUP keyword

  #+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
  - ~inlineimages~   show inline images
  - ~noinlineimages~ don't show inline images on startup

The key {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} has many purposes in Org, which are all
mentioned scattered throughout this manual.  One specific function of
this key is to add /tags/ to a headline (see [[Tags]]).  In many
other circumstances it means something like "Hey Org, look
here and update according to what you see here."  Here is a summary of
what this means in different contexts.

- If there are highlights in the buffer from the creation of a sparse
  tree, or from clock display, remove these highlights.
- If the cursor is in one of the special ~#+KEYWORD~ lines, this
  triggers scanning the buffer for these lines and updating the
  information.
- If the cursor is inside a table, realign the table.  This command
  works even if the automatic table editor has been turned off.
- If the cursor is on a ~#+TBLFM~ line, re-apply the formulas to the
  entire table.
- If the current buffer is a capture buffer, close the note and file
  it.  With a prefix argument, file it, without further interaction, to
  the default location.
- If the cursor is on a ~<<<target>>>~, update radio targets and
  corresponding links in this buffer.
- If the cursor is in a property line or at the start or end of a
  property drawer, offer property commands.
- If the cursor is at a footnote reference, go to the corresponding
  definition, and vice versa.
-  If the cursor is on a statistics cookie, update it.
- If the cursor is in a plain list item with a checkbox, toggle the
  status of the checkbox.
- If the cursor is on a numbered item in a plain list, renumber the
  ordered list.
- If the cursor is on the ~#+BEGIN~ line of a dynamic block, the block
  is updated.
- If the cursor is at a timestamp, fix the day name in the timestamp.

** Clean view

   :TITLE:    A cleaner outline view
   :END:
#+cindex: hiding leading stars
#+cindex: dynamic indentation
#+cindex: odd-levels-only outlines
#+cindex: clean outline view

Some people find it noisy and distracting that the Org headlines start
with a potentially large number of stars, and that text below the
headlines is not indented.  While this is no problem when writing a
/book-like/ document where the outline headings are really section
headings, in a more /list-oriented/ outline, indented structure is a
lot cleaner:

#+begin_example
   ,* Top level headline             |    * Top level headline
   ,** Second level                  |      * Second level
   ,*** 3rd level                    |        * 3rd level
   some text                        |          some text
   ,*** 3rd level                    |        * 3rd level
   more text                        |          more text
   ,* Another top level headline     |    * Another top level headline
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} If you are using at least Emacs 23.2 and version 6.29
of Org, this kind of view can be achieved dynamically at display time
using ~org-indent-mode~.[fn:183] In this minor mode, all lines are
prefixed for display with the necessary amount of space.[fn:154] Also
headlines are prefixed with additional stars, so that the amount of
indentation shifts by two spaces per level.[fn:155] All headline stars
but the last one are made invisible using the ~org-hide~ face---see
below under {{{samp(2.)}}} for more information on how this
works.[fn:156] You can turn on ~org-indent-mode~ for all files by
customizing the variable ~org-startup-indented~, or you can turn it on
for individual files using

#+begin_example
   ,#+STARTUP: indent
#+end_example

If you want a similar effect in an earlier version of Emacs and/or
Org, or if you want the indentation to be hard space characters so
that the plain text file looks as similar as possible to the Emacs
display, Org supports you in the following way:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- Indentation of text below headlines ::

  You may indent text below each headline to make the left boundary line up
  with the headline, like

  #+begin_example
     ,*** 3rd level
         more text, now indented
  #+end_example

  #+vindex: org-adapt-indentation

  Org supports this with paragraph filling, line wrapping, and structure
  editing,
  preserving or adapting the indentation as appropriate.[fn:157]

- Hiding leading stars ::
  #+vindex: org-hide-leading-stars

  You can modify the display in such a way that all leading stars become
  invisible.  To do this in a global way, configure the variable
  ~org-hide-leading-stars~ or change this on a per-file basis with

  #+begin_example
     ,#+STARTUP: hidestars
     ,#+STARTUP: showstars
  #+end_example

  With hidden stars, the tree becomes:

  #+begin_example
     ,* Top level headline
     , * Second level
     ,  * 3rd level
       ...
  #+end_example

  #+vindex: org-hide @r{(face)}

  {{{noindent}}} The leading stars are not truly replaced by whitespace,
  they are only fontified with the face ~org-hide~ that uses the
  background color as font color.  If you are not using either white or
  black background, you may have to customize this face to get the
  wanted effect.  Another possibility is to set this font such that the
  extra stars are /almost/ invisible, for example using the color
  ~grey90~ on a white background.
- Odd levels ::
  #+vindex: org-odd-levels-only

  Things become cleaner still if you skip all the even levels and use
  only odd levels 1, 3, 5, ..., effectively adding two stars to go from
  one outline level to the next.[fn:158] In this way we get the outline
  view shown at the beginning of this section.  In order to make the
  structure editing and export commands handle this convention
  correctly, configure the variable ~org-odd-levels-only~, or set this
  on a per-file basis with one of the following lines:

  #+begin_example
     ,#+STARTUP: odd
     ,#+STARTUP: oddeven
  #+end_example

  You can convert an Org file from single-star-per-level to the
  double-star-per-level convention with {{{kbdkey(M-x
  org-convert-to-odd-levels , RET)}}} in that file.  The reverse
  operation is {{{kbd(M-x org-convert-to-oddeven-levels)}}}.

** TTY keys
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Using Org on a tty
   :TITLE:    Using Org on a tty
   :END:

Because Org contains a large number of commands, by default many of
Org's core commands are bound to keys that are generally not
accessible on a tty, such as the cursor keys ({{{key(left)}}},
{{{key(right)}}}, {{{key(up)}}}, {{{key(down)}}}), {{{key(TAB)}}} and
{{{key(RET)}}}, in particular when used together with modifiers like
{{{key(Meta)}}} and/or {{{key(Shift)}}}.  To access these commands on a
tty when special keys are unavailable, the following alternative
bindings can be used.  The tty bindings below will likely be more
cumbersome; you may find for some of the bindings below that a
customized workaround suits you better.  For example, changing a
timestamp is really only fun with {{{kbdkey(S-,cursor)}}} keys,
whereas on a tty you would rather use {{{kbd(C-c .)}}} to re-insert
the timestamp.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{file(calc.el)}}} by Dave Gillespie ::
  #+cindex: @file{calc.el}
  #+cindex: Gillespie, Dave

  Org uses the Calc package for implementing spreadsheet functionality
  in its tables (see [[The spreadsheet]]).  Org checks for the availability
  of Calc by looking for the function ~calc-eval~ which will have been
  autoloaded during setup if Calc has been installed properly.  As of
  Emacs 22, Calc is part of the Emacs distribution.  Another possibility
  for interaction between the two packages is using Calc for embedded
  calculations.  See [[info:calc:Embedded Mode][GNU Emacs Calc Manual]].

- {{{file(constants.el)}}} by Carsten Dominik ::
  #+cindex: @file{constants.el}
  #+cindex: Dominik, Carsten
  #+vindex: org-table-formula-constants

  In a table formula (see [[The spreadsheet]]), it is possible to use names
  for natural constants or units.  Instead of defining your own constants
  in the variable ~org-table-formula-constants~, install the
  {{{file(constants)}}} package which defines a large number of
  constants and units, and lets you use unit prefixes like {{{samp(M)}}}
  for {{{samp(Mega)}}}, etc.  You will need version 2.0 of this package,
  available at [[http://www.astro.uva.nl/~dominik/Tools]].  Org checks for
  the function ~constants-get~, which has to be autoloaded in your
  setup.  See the installation instructions in the file
  {{{file(constants.el)}}}.

- {{{file(cdlatex.el)}}} by Carsten Dominik ::
  #+cindex: @file{cdlatex.el}
  #+cindex: Dominik, Carsten

  Org mode can make use of the CDLaTeX package to efficiently enter
  LaTeX fragments into Org files.  See [[CDLaTeX mode]].

- {{{file(imenu.el)}}} by Ake Stenhoff and Lars Lindberg ::
  #+cindex: @file{imenu.el}
  #+cindex: Stenhoff, Ake
  #+cindex: Lindberg, Lars

  Imenu allows menu access to an index of items in a file.  Org mode
  supports Imenu---all you need to do to get the index is the following:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
            (lambda () (imenu-add-to-menubar "Imenu")))
  #+end_src

  #+vindex: org-imenu-depth

  By default the index is two levels deep---you can modify the depth
  using the option ~org-imenu-depth~.

- {{{file(remember.el)}}} by John Wiegley ::
  #+cindex: @file{remember.el}
  #+cindex: Wiegley, John

  Org used to use this package for capture, but no longer does.

- {{{file(speedbar.el)}}} by Eric M. Ludlam ::
  #+cindex: @file{speedbar.el}
  #+cindex: Ludlam, Eric M.

  Speedbar is a package that creates a special frame displaying files and
  index items in files.  Org mode supports Speedbar and allows you to
  drill into Org files directly from the Speedbar.  It also allows you to
  restrict the scope of agenda commands to a file or a subtree by using
  the command {{{kbd(<)}}} in the Speedbar frame.

- {{{file(table.el)}}} by Takaaki Ota ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-c
  #+cindex: table editor, @file{table.el}
  #+cindex: @file{table.el}
  #+cindex: Ota, Takaaki

  Complex ASCII tables with automatic line wrapping, column- and row-spanning,
  and alignment can be created using the Emacs table package by Takaaki Ota
  ([[http://sourceforge.net/projects/table]], and also part of Emacs 22).
  Org mode will recognize these tables and export them properly.  Because of
  interference with other Org mode functionality, you unfortunately cannot edit
  these tables directly in the buffer.  Instead, you need to use the command
  {{{kbd(C-c ')}}} to edit them, similar to source code snippets.

  - {{{kbd(C-c ')}}}, ~org-edit-special~ ::
    #+kindex: C-c '

    Edit a {{{file(table.el)}}} table.  Works when the cursor is in a
    table.el table.

  - {{{kbd(C-c XXX)}}}, ~org-table-create-with-table.el~ ::
    #+kindex: C-c ~
    # Should be ~
    Insert a {{{file(table.el)}}} table.  If there is already a table at
    point, this command converts it between the {{{file(table.el)}}}
    format and the Org mode format.  See the documentation string of the
    command ~org-convert-table~ for the restrictions under which this is
    possible.

  {{{file(table.el)}}} is part of Emacs since Emacs 22.

- {{{file(footnote.el)}}} by Steven L. Baur ::
  #+cindex: @file{footnote.el}
  #+cindex: Baur, Steven L.

  Org mode recognizes numerical footnotes as provided by this package.
  However, Org mode also has its own footnote support (see [[Creating footnotes]]),
  which makes using {{{file(footnote.el)}}} unnecessary.

*** Conflicts
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Packages that lead to conflicts
    :END:

#+cindex: @code{shift-selection-mode}
#+vindex: org-support-shift-select

In Emacs 23, ~shift-selection-mode~ is on by default, meaning that
cursor motions combined with the shift key should start or enlarge
regions.  This conflicts with the use of {{{kbdkey(S-,cursor)}}}
commands in Org to change timestamps, TODO keywords, priorities, and
item bullet types if the cursor is at such a location.  By default,
{{{kbdkey(S-,cursor)}}} commands outside special contexts don't do
anything, but you can customize the variable
~org-support-shift-select~.  Org mode then tries to accommodate shift
selection by using it outside of the special contexts where
special commands apply, and by extending an existing active
region even if the cursor moves across a special context.

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{file(CUA.el)}}} by Kim. F. Storm ::
  #+cindex: @file{CUA.el}
  #+cindex: Storm, Kim. F.
  #+vindex: org-replace-disputed-keys

  Key bindings in Org conflict with the {{{kbdkey(S-,<cursor>)}}} keys
  used by CUA mode (as well as ~pc-select-mode~ and ~s-region-mode~) to
  select and extend the region.  In fact, Emacs 23 has this built-in in
  the form of ~shift-selection-mode~, see previous paragraph.  If you are
  using Emacs 23, you probably don't want to use another package for
  this purpose.  However, if you prefer to leave these keys to a
  different package while working in Org mode, configure the variable
  ~org-replace-disputed-keys~.  When set, Org will move the following key
  bindings in Org files, and in the agenda buffer (but not during date
  selection).

  | S-UP      {{{result}}}  M-p   | S-DOWN     {{{result}}}  M-n   |
  | S-LEFT    {{{result}}}  M--   | S-RIGHT    {{{result}}}  M-+   |
  | C-S-LEFT  {{{result}}}  M-S-- | C-S-RIGHT  {{{result}}}  M-S-+ |

  #+vindex: org-disputed-keys

  Yes, these are unfortunately more difficult to remember.  If you want
  to have other replacement keys, look at the variable
  ~org-disputed-keys~.

- {{{file(filladapt.el)}}} by Kyle Jones ::
  #+cindex: @file{filladapt.el}
  #+cindex: Jones, Kyle

  Org mode tries to do the right thing when filling paragraphs, list
  items and other elements.  Many users reported they had problems using
  both {{{file(filladapt.el)}}} and Org mode, so a safe thing to do is
  to disable it like this:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-off-filladapt-mode)
  #+end_src

- {{{file(yasnippet.el)}}} ::
  #+cindex: @file{yasnippet.el}

  The way Org mode binds the {{{key(TAB)}}} key (binding to ~[tab]~
  instead of ~"\t"~) overrules YASnippet's access to this key.  The
  following code fixed this problem:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (setq-local yas/trigger-key [tab])
              (define-key yas/keymap [tab] 'yas/next-field-or-maybe-expand)))
  #+end_src

  The latest version of yasnippet doesn't play well with Org mode.  If the
  above code does not fix the conflict, start by defining the following
  function:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun yas/org-very-safe-expand ()
         (let ((yas/fallback-behavior 'return-nil)) (yas/expand)))
  #+end_src

  Then, tell Org mode what to do with the new function:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
                (make-variable-buffer-local 'yas/trigger-key)
                (setq yas/trigger-key [tab])
                (add-to-list 'org-tab-first-hook 'yas/org-very-safe-expand)
                (define-key yas/keymap [tab] 'yas/next-field)))
  #+end_src

- {{{file(windmove.el)}}} by Hovav Shacham ::
  #+cindex: @file{windmove.el}
  #+cindex: Shacham, Hovav

  This package also uses the {{{kbd(S-<cursor>)}}} keys, so everything
  written in the paragraph above about CUA mode also applies here.  If
  you want make the windmove function active in locations where Org mode
  does not have special functionality on {{{kbdkey(S-,cursor)}}}, add
  this to your configuration:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Make windmove work in org-mode:
  (add-hook 'org-shiftup-final-hook 'windmove-up)
  (add-hook 'org-shiftleft-final-hook 'windmove-left)
  (add-hook 'org-shiftdown-final-hook 'windmove-down)
  (add-hook 'org-shiftright-final-hook 'windmove-right)
  #+end_src

- {{{file(viper.el)}}} by Michael Kifer ::
  #+cindex: @file{viper.el}
  #+cindex: Kifer, Michael
  #+kindex: C-c /

  Viper uses {{{kbd(C-c /)}}} and therefore makes this key not access the
  corresponding Org mode command ~org-sparse-tree~.  You need to find
  another key for this command, or override the key in
  ~viper-vi-global-user-map~ with

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (define-key viper-vi-global-user-map "C-c /" 'org-sparse-tree)
  #+end_src

** org-crypt
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Encrypting Org files
   :END:
#+cindex: @file{+org-crypt.el}
#+cindex: @code{org-decrypt-entry}

Org-crypt will encrypt the text of an entry, but not the headline, or
properties.  Org-crypt uses the Emacs EasyPG library to encrypt and
decrypt files.

Any text below a headline that has a {{{samp(:crypt:)}}} tag will
automatically be encrypted when the file is saved.  If you want to use
a different tag just customize the ~org-crypt-tag-matcher~ setting.

To use org-crypt it is suggested that you have the following in your
{{{file(.emacs)}}}:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org-crypt)
(org-crypt-use-before-save-magic)
(setq org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance (quote ("crypt")))

(setq org-crypt-key nil)
  ;; GPG key to use for encryption
  ;; Either the Key ID or set to nil to use symmetric encryption.

(setq auto-save-default nil)
  ;; Auto-saving does not cooperate with org-crypt.el: so you need
  ;; to turn it off if you plan to use org-crypt.el quite often.
  ;; Otherwise, you'll get an (annoying) message each time you
  ;; start Org.

  ;; To turn it off only locally, you can insert this:
  ;;
  ;; # -*- buffer-auto-save-file-name: nil; -*-
#+end_src

Excluding the crypt tag from inheritance prevents already encrypted text
being encrypted again.

If you would like to add new link types, Org provides an interface for
doing so.  Let's look at an example file, {{{file(org-man.el)}}}, that
will add support for creating links like:

#+begin_example
   [[man:printf][The printf manual]]
#+end_example

to show Unix manual pages inside Emacs:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org-man)
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} Let's go through the file and see what it does.
#+vindex: org-store-link-functions

1. It does ~(require 'org)~ to make sure that {{{file(org.el)}}} has
   been loaded.

2. The next line calls ~org-add-link-type~ to define a new link type
   with prefix {{{samp(man)}}}.  The call also contains the name of a
   function that will be called to follow such a link.

3. The next line adds a function to ~org-store-link-functions~, in
   order to allow the command {{{kbd(C-c l)}}} to record a useful link
   in a buffer displaying a man page.
   

The rest of the file defines the necessary variables and functions.
First there is a customization variable that determines which Emacs
command should be used to display man pages.  There are two options,
~man~ and ~woman~.  Then the function to follow a link is defined.  It
gets the link path as an argument---in this case the link path is just
a topic for the manual command.  The function calls the value of
~org-man-command~ to display the man page.

Finally the function ~org-man-store-link~ is defined.  When you try to
store a link with {{{kbd(C-c l)}}}, this function will be called to
try to make a link.  The function must first decide if it is supposed
to create the link for this buffer type; we do this by checking the
value of the variable ~major-mode~.  If not, the function must exit and
return the value ~nil~.  If yes, the link is created by getting the
manual topic from the buffer name and prefixing it with the string
{{{samp(man:)}}}.  Then it must call the command ~org-store-link-props~
and set the ~:type~ and ~:link~ properties.  Optionally you can also
set the ~:description~ property to provide a default for the link
description when the link is later inserted into an Org buffer with
{{{kbd(C-c C-l)}}}.

When it makes sense for your new link type, you may also define a
function that implements special (e.g., completion) support for
inserting such a link with {{{kbd(C-c C-l)}}}.  Such a function should
not accept any arguments, and return the full link with prefix.

** Context-sensitive commands
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: How to add functionality to such commands
   :END:
#+cindex: context-sensitive commands, hooks
#+cindex: add-ons, context-sensitive commands
#+vindex: org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c-hook

Org has several commands that act differently depending on context.
The most important example is the {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} (see [[The very
busy C-c C-c key]]).  Also the {{{kbd(M-cursor)}}} and
{{{kbd(M-S-cursor)}}} keys have this property.

Add-ons can tap into this functionality by providing a function that
detects special context for that add-on and executes functionality
appropriate for the context.  Here is an example from Dan Davison's
{{{file(org-R.el)}}} which allows you to evaluate commands based on
the {{{file(R)}}} programming language.[fn:159] For this package,
special contexts are lines that start with ~#+R:~ or ~#+RR:~.

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-R-apply-maybe ()
  "Detect if this is context for org-R and execute R commands."
  (if (save-excursion
        (beginning-of-line 1)
        (looking-at "#\\+RR?:"))
      (progn (call-interactively 'org-R-apply)
             t) ;; to signal that we took action
    nil)) ;; to signal that we did not

(add-hook 'org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c-hook 'org-R-apply-maybe)
#+end_src

The function first checks if the cursor is in such a line.  If that is
the case, ~org-R-apply~ is called and the function returns ~t~ to
signal that action was taken, and {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} will stop looking
for other contexts.  If the function finds it should do nothing
locally, it returns ~nil~ so that other, similar functions can have a
try.

** Tables in arbitrary syntax
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Orgtbl for LaTeX and other programs
   :END:
#+cindex: tables, in other modes
#+cindex: lists, in other modes
#+cindex: Orgtbl mode

Since Orgtbl mode can be used as a minor mode in arbitrary buffers, a
frequent feature request has been to make it work with native tables
in specific languages, for example LaTeX.  However, this is
extremely hard to do in a general way, would lead to a customization
nightmare, and would take away much of the simplicity of the Orgtbl
mode table editor.

This appendix describes a different approach.  We keep the Orgtbl mode
table in its native format (the source table), and use a custom
function to /translate/ the table to the correct syntax, and to
/install/ it in the right location (the target table).  This puts
the burden of writing conversion functions on the user, but it allows
for a very flexible system.

Bastien added the ability to do the same with lists, in Orgstruct
mode.  You can use Org's facilities to edit and structure lists by
turning ~orgstruct-mode~ on, then locally exporting such lists in
another format (HTML, LaTeX or Texinfo.)

*** Radio tables
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Sending and receiving radio tables
    :END:
#+cindex: radio tables

To define the location of the target table, you first need to create
two lines that are comments in the current mode, but contain magic
words for Orgtbl mode to find.  Orgtbl mode will insert the translated
table between these lines, replacing whatever was there before.  For
example:

#+begin_example
   /* BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL table_name */
   /* END RECEIVE ORGTBL table_name */
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} Just above the source table, we put a special line that
tells Orgtbl mode how to translate this table and where to install it.
For example: 

#+cindex: #+ORGTBL
#+begin_example
   ,#+ORGTBL: SEND table_name translation_function arguments ...
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} Here, ~table_name~ is the reference name for the table
that is also used in the receiver lines.  ~translation_function~ is the
Lisp function that does the translation.  Furthermore, the line can
contain a list of arguments (alternating key and value) at the end.
The arguments will be passed as a property list to the translation
function for interpretation.  A few standard parameters are already
recognized and acted upon before the translation function is called:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~:skip N~ ::

  Skip the first N lines of the table.  Hlines do count as separate lines
  for this parameter!

- ~:skipcols (n1 n2 ...)~ ::

  List of columns that should be skipped.  If the table has a column with
  calculation marks, that column is automatically discarded as well.
  Please note that the translator function sees the table /after/ the
  removal of these columns, the function never knows that there have
  been additional columns.

- ~:no-escape t~ ::

  When non-nil, do not escape special characters ~&%#_^~ when exporting
  the table.  The default value is nil.


{{{noindent}}} The one problem remaining is how to keep the source
table in the buffer without disturbing the normal workings of the
file, for example during compilation of a C file or processing of a
LaTeX file.  There are a number of different solutions:

- The table could be placed in a block comment if that is supported by
  the language.  For example, in C mode you could wrap the table
  between {{{samp(/*)}}} and {{{samp(*/)}}} lines.

- Sometimes it is possible to put the table after some kind of END
  statement, for example ~\bye~ in TeX and ~\end{document}~ in
  LaTeX.

- You can just comment the table line-by-line whenever you want to
  process the file, and uncomment it whenever you need to edit the
  table.  This only sounds tedious---the command {{{kbd(M-x
  orgtbl-toggle-comment)}}} makes this comment-toggling very easy, in
  particular if you bind it to a key.

*** A LaTeX example
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Step by step, almost a tutorial
    :TITLE:    A LaTeX example of radio tables
    :END:
#+cindex: @LaTeX{}, and Orgtbl mode

The best way to wrap the source table in LaTeX is to use the
~comment~ environment provided by {{{file(comment.sty)}}}.  It has to
be activated by placing ~\usepackage{comment}~ into the document
header.  Orgtbl mode can insert a radio table skeleton with the command
{{{kbd(M-x orgtbl-insert-radio-table)}}}.[fn:160] You will be prompted
for a table name, let's say we use {{{samp(salesfigures)}}}.  You will
then get the following template:

#+cindex: #+ORGTBL, SEND
#+begin_example
   % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
   % END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
   \begin{comment}
   #+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex
   | | |
   \end{comment}
#+end_example

#+vindex: @LaTeX{}-verbatim-environments

{{{noindent}}} The ~#+ORGTBL: SEND~ line tells Orgtbl mode to use the
function ~orgtbl-to-latex~ to convert the table into LaTeX and to
put it into the receiver location with name ~salesfigures~.  You may
now fill in the table---feel free to use the spreadsheet features:[fn:161]

#+begin_example
   % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
   % END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
   \begin{comment}
   #+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex
   | Month | Days | Nr sold | per day |
   |-------+------+---------+---------|
   | Jan   |   23 |      55 |     2.4 |
   | Feb   |   21 |      16 |     0.8 |
   | March |   22 |     278 |    12.6 |
   #+TBLFM: $4=$3/$2;%.1f
   % $ (optional extra dollar to keep font-lock happy, see footnote)
   \end{comment}
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} When you are done, press {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} in the
table to get the converted table inserted between the two marker
lines.

Now let's assume you want to make the table header by hand, because
you want to control how columns are aligned, etc.  In this case we make
sure that the table translator skips the first 2 lines of the source
table, and tell the command to work as a splice, i.e., to not
produce header and footer commands of the target table:

#+begin_example
   \begin{tabular}{lrrr}
   Month & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Days} & Nr.\ sold & per day\\
   % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
   % END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
   \end{tabular}
   %
   \begin{comment}
   #+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex :splice t :skip 2
   | Month | Days | Nr sold | per day |
   |-------+------+---------+---------|
   | Jan   |   23 |      55 |     2.4 |
   | Feb   |   21 |      16 |     0.8 |
   | March |   22 |     278 |    12.6 |
   #+TBLFM: $4=$3/$2;%.1f
   \end{comment}
#+end_example

The LaTeX translator function ~orgtbl-to-latex~ is already part of
Orgtbl mode.  It uses a ~tabular~ environment to typeset the table and
marks horizontal lines with ~\hline~.  Furthermore, it interprets the
following parameters (see also see [[Translator functions]]):

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~:splice nil/t~ ::

  When set to ~t~, return only table body lines, don't wrap them into a
  tabular environment.  Default is ~nil~.

- ~:fmt fmt~ ::

  A format to be used to wrap each field, it should contain ~%s~ for the
  original field value.  For example, to wrap each field value in
  dollars, you could use ~:fmt "$%s$"~.  This may also be a property list
  with column numbers and formats, for example ~:fmt (2 "$%s$" 4
  "%s\\%%")~.  A function of one argument can be used in place of the
  strings; the function must return a formatted string.

- ~:efmt efmt~ ::

  Use this format to print numbers with exponentials.  The format should
  have ~%s~ twice for inserting mantissa and exponent, for example:

  #+begin_example
     "%s\\times10^{%s}"
  #+end_example

  The default is:

  #+begin_example
     "%s\\,(%s)"
  #+end_example

  This may also be a property list with column numbers and formats, for
  example:

  #+begin_example
     :efmt (2 "$%s\\times10^{%s}$" 4 "$%s\\cdot10^{%s}$")
  #+end_example

  After ~efmt~ has been applied to a value, ~fmt~ will also be applied.
  Similar to ~fmt~, functions of two arguments can be supplied instead
  of strings.

*** Translator functions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Copy and modify
    :END:
#+cindex: HTML, and Orgtbl mode
#+cindex: translator function

Orgtbl mode has several translator functions built-in: ~orgtbl-to-csv~
(comma-separated values), ~orgtbl-to-tsv~ (TAB-separated values)
~orgtbl-to-latex~, ~orgtbl-to-html~, and ~orgtbl-to-texinfo~.  Except
for ~orgtbl-to-html~, these all use a generic translator,
~orgtbl-to-generic~.[fn:162] For example, ~orgtbl-to-latex~ itself is
a very short function that computes the column definitions for the
~tabular~ environment, defines a few field and line separators and
then hands processing over to the generic translator.  Here is the
entire code:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun orgtbl-to-latex (table params)
  "Convert the Orgtbl mode TABLE to LaTeX."
  (let* ((alignment (mapconcat (lambda (x) (if x "r" "l"))
                               org-table-last-alignment ""))
         (params2
          (list
           :tstart (concat "\\begin@{tabular@}@{" alignment "@}")
           :tend "\\end@{tabular@}"
           :lstart "" :lend " \\\\" :sep " & "
           :efmt "%s\\,(%s)" :hline "\\hline")))
    (orgtbl-to-generic table (org-combine-plists params2 params))))
#+end_src

As you can see, the properties passed into the function (variable
~PARAMS~) are combined with the ones newly defined in the function
(variable ~PARAMS2~).  The ones passed into the function (i.e., the
ones set by the {{{samp(ORGTBL SEND)}}} line) take precedence.  So if
you would like to use the LaTeX translator, but wanted the line
endings to be ~\\[2mm]~ instead of the default ~\\~, you could just
overrule the default with:

#+begin_example
   ,#+ORGTBL: SEND test orgtbl-to-latex :lend " \\\\[2mm]"
#+end_example

For a new language, you can either write your own converter function
in analogy with the LaTeX translator, or you can use the generic
function directly.  For example, if you have a language where a table
is started with {{{samp(!BTBL!)}}}, ended with {{{samp(!ETBL!)}}}, and
where table lines are started with {{{samp(!BL!)}}}, ended with
{{{samp(!EL!)}}}, and where the field separator is a TAB, you could
call the generic translator like this (on a single line!):

#+begin_example
   ,#+ORGTBL: SEND test orgtbl-to-generic :tstart "!BTBL!" :tend "!ETBL!"
                                 :lstart "!BL! " :lend " !EL!" :sep "\t"
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} Please check the documentation string of the function
~orgtbl-to-generic~ for a full list of parameters understood by that
function, and remember that you can pass each of them into
~orgtbl-to-latex~, ~orgtbl-to-texinfo~, and any other function using
the generic function.

Of course you can also write a completely new function doing
complicated things the generic translator cannot do.  A translator
function takes two arguments.  The first argument is the table, a list
of lines, each line either the symbol ~hline~ or a list of fields.  The
second argument is the property list containing all parameters
specified in the {{{samp(#+ORGTBL: SEND)}}} line.  The function must
return a single string containing the formatted table.  If you write a
generally useful translator, please post it to the [[mailto:emacs-orgmode@gnu.org][mailing list]] so
that others can benefit from your work.

*** Radio lists
    :PROPERTIES:
    :DESCRIPTION: Doing the same for lists
    :END:
#+cindex: radio lists
#+cindex: org-list-insert-radio-list

Sending and receiving radio lists works exactly the same way as
sending and receiving radio tables (see [[Radio tables]]).  As for radio
tables, you can insert radio list templates in HTML, LaTeX and
Texinfo modes by calling ~org-list-insert-radio-list~.

Here are the differences with radio tables:

- Orgstruct mode must be active.

- Use the ~ORGLST~ keyword instead of ~ORGTBL~.

- The available translation functions for radio lists don't take
  parameters.

- {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} will work when pressed on the first item of the
  list.


Here is a LaTeX example.  Let's say that you have this in your
LaTeX file:

#+cindex: #+ORGLST
#+begin_example
   % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGLST to-buy
   % END RECEIVE ORGLST to-buy
   \begin{comment}
   #+ORGLST: SEND to-buy org-list-to-latex
   - a new house
   - a new computer
     + a new keyboard
     + a new mouse
   - a new life
   \end{comment}
#+end_example

Pressing `C-c C-c' on ~a new house~ will insert the converted
LaTeX list between the two marker lines.

** Dynamic blocks
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Automatically filled blocks
   :END:
#+cindex: dynamic blocks

Org documents can contain /dynamic blocks/.  These are specially marked
regions that are updated by some user-written function.  A good example
for such a block is the clock table inserted by the command 
{{{kbd(C-c C-x C-r)}}} (see [[Clocking work time]]).

Dynamic blocks are enclosed by a BEGIN-END structure that assigns a
name to the block and can also specify parameters for the function
producing the content of the block.

#+cindex: #+BEGIN:dynamic block
#+begin_example
   ,#+BEGIN: myblock :parameter1 value1 :parameter2 value2 ...

   ,#+END:
#+end_example

Dynamic blocks are updated with the following commands:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{kbd(C-c C-x C-u)}}}, ~org-dblock-update~ ::
  #+kindex: C-c C-x C-u

  Update dynamic block at point.

- {{{kbd(C-u C-c C-x C-u)}}} ::
  #+kindex: C-u C-c C-x C-u

  Update all dynamic blocks in the current file.


Updating a dynamic block means to remove all the text between ~BEGIN~
and ~END~, parse the ~BEGIN~ line for parameters and then call the
specific writer function for this block to insert the new content.  If
you want to use the original content in the writer function, you can
use the extra parameter ~:content~.

For a block with name ~myblock~, the writer function is
~org-dblock-write:myblock~ with as only parameter a property list
with the parameters given in the begin line.  Here is a trivial example
of a block that keeps track of when the block update function was last
run:

#+begin_example
   ,#+BEGIN: block-update-time :format "on %m/%d/%Y at %H:%M"

   ,#+END:
#+end_example

{{{noindent}}} The corresponding block writer function could look like
this:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun org-dblock-write:block-update-time (params)
   (let ((fmt (or (plist-get params :format) "%d. %m. %Y")))
     (insert "Last block update at: "
             (format-time-string fmt (current-time)))))
#+end_src

If you want to make sure that all dynamic blocks are always
up-to-date, you could add the function ~org-update-all-dblocks~ to a
hook, for example ~before-save-hook~.  ~org-update-all-dblocks~ is
written in a way such that it does nothing in buffers that are not in
~org-mode~.

You can narrow the current buffer to the current dynamic block (like
any other block) with ~org-narrow-to-block~.

** Special agenda views
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Customized views
   :END:
#+cindex: agenda views, user-defined
#+vindex: org-agenda-skip-function
#+vindex: org-agenda-skip-function-global

Org provides a special hook that can be used to narrow down the
selection made by these agenda views: ~agenda~, ~todo~, ~alltodo~,
~tags~, ~tags-todo~, ~tags-tree~.  You may specify a function that is
used at each match to verify if the match should indeed be part of the
agenda view, and if not, how much should be skipped.  You can specify a
global condition that will be applied to all agenda views, this
condition would be stored in the variable
~org-agenda-skip-function-global~.  More commonly, such a definition is
applied only to specific custom searches, using
~org-agenda-skip-function~.

Let's say you want to produce a list of projects that contain a
~WAITING~ tag anywhere in the project tree.  Let's further assume that
you have marked all tree headings that define a project with the TODO
keyword PROJECT.  In this case you would run a TODO search for the
keyword PROJECT, but skip the match unless there is a ~WAITING~ tag
anywhere in the subtree belonging to the project line.

To achieve this, you must write a function that searches the subtree for
the tag.  If the tag is found, the function must return ~nil~ to
indicate that this match should not be skipped.  If there is no such
tag, return the location of the end of the subtree, to indicate that
search should continue from there.

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my-skip-unless-waiting ()
  "Skip trees that are not waiting"
  (let ((subtree-end (save-excursion (org-end-of-subtree t))))
    (if (re-search-forward ":waiting:" subtree-end t)
        nil          ; tag found, do not skip
      subtree-end))) ; tag not found, continue after end of subtree
#+end_src

Now you may use this function in an agenda custom command, for example
like this:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-add-agenda-custom-command
 '("b" todo "PROJECT"
   ((org-agenda-skip-function 'my-skip-unless-waiting)
    (org-agenda-overriding-header "Projects waiting for something: "))))
#+end_src

#+vindex: org-agenda-overriding-header

Note that this also binds ~org-agenda-overriding-header~ to get a
meaningful header in the agenda view.

#+vindex: org-odd-levels-only
#+vindex: org-agenda-skip-function

A general way to create custom searches is to base them on a search
for entries with a certain level limit.  If you want to study all
entries with your custom search function, simply do a search for
{{{samp(LEVEL>0)}}}, and then use ~org-agenda-skip-function~ to select
the entries you really want to have.[fn:163]

You may also put a Lisp form into ~org-agenda-skip-function~.  In
particular, you may use the functions ~org-agenda-skip-entry-if~
and ~org-agenda-skip-subtree-if~ in this form, for example:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- {{{samp((org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled))}}} ::

  Skip current entry if it has been scheduled.

- {{{samp((org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'notscheduled))}}} ::

  Skip current entry if it has not been scheduled.

- {{{samp((org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'deadline))}}} ::

  Skip current entry if it has a deadline.

- {{{samp((org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled 'deadline))}}} ::

  Skip current entry if it has a deadline, or if it is scheduled.

- {{{samp((org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'todo '("TODO" "WAITING")))}}} ::

  Skip current entry if the TODO keyword is TODO or WAITING.

- {{{samp((org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'todo 'done))}}} ::

  Skip current entry if the TODO keyword marks a DONE state.

- {{{samp((org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'timestamp))}}} ::

  Skip current entry if it has any timestamp, may also be deadline or scheduled.
  <<x-agenda-skip-entry-regexp>>

- {{{samp((org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'regexp "regular expression"))}}} ::
  
  Skip current entry if the regular expression matches in the entry.

- {{{samp((org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'notregexp "regular expression"))}}} ::

  Skip current entry unless the regular expression matches.

- {{{samp((org-agenda-skip-subtree-if 'regexp "regular expression"))}}} ::

  Same as above, but check and skip the entire subtree.


Therefore we could also have written the search for WAITING projects
like this, even without defining a special function:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-add-agenda-custom-command
 '("b" todo "PROJECT"
   ((org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-subtree-if
                                'regexp ":waiting:"))
    (org-agenda-overriding-header "Projects waiting for something: "))))
#+end_src

** Extracting agenda information
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Post-processing agenda information
   :END:
#+cindex: agenda, pipe
#+cindex: Scripts, for agenda processing
#+vindex: org-agenda-custom-commands

Org provides commands to access agenda information for the command
line in Emacs batch mode.  This extracted information can be sent
directly to a printer, or it can be read by a program that does
further processing of the data.  The first of these commands is the
function ~org-batch-agenda~, that produces an agenda view and sends it
as ASCII text to STDOUT.  The command takes a single string as
parameter.  If the string has length 1, it is used as a key to one of
the commands you have configured in ~org-agenda-custom-commands~,
basically any key you can use after {{{kbd(C-c a)}}}.  For example, to
directly print the current TODO list, you could use:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src sh
emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -eval '(org-batch-agenda "t")' | lpr
#+end_src

If the parameter is a string with 2 or more characters, it is used as
a tags/TODO match string.  For example, to print your local shopping
list (all items with the tag {{{samp(shop)}}}, but excluding the tag
{{{samp(NewYork)}}}), you could use:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src sh
emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs                                      \
      -eval '(org-batch-agenda "+shop-NewYork")' | lpr
#+end_src

{{{noindent}}} You may also modify parameters on the fly like this:

#+header: :eval no

{{{noindent}}} which will produce a 30-day agenda, fully restricted to
the Org file {{{file(~/org/projects.org)}}}, not even including the
diary.

If you want to process the agenda data in more sophisticated ways, you
can use the command ~org-batch-agenda-csv~ to get a comma-separated
list of values for each agenda item.  Each line in the output will
contain a number of fields separated by commas.  The fields in a line
are:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @code
- category ::     The category of the item
- head ::        The headline, without TODO keyword, TAGS and PRIORITY
- type ::        The type of the agenda entry, can be:
  - todo ::               selected in TODO match
  - tagsmatch ::          selected in tags match
  - diary ::              imported from diary
  - deadline ::           a deadline
  - scheduled ::         scheduled
  - timestamp ::         appointment, selected by timestamp
  - closed ::            entry was closed on date
  - upcoming-deadline ::  warning about nearing deadline
  - past-scheduled ::     forwarded scheduled item
  - block ::              entry has date block including date
- todo ::         The TODO keyword, if any
- tags ::        All tags including inherited ones, separated by colons
- date ::        The relevant date, like 2007-2-14
- time ::        The time, like 15:00-16:50
- extra ::       String with extra planning info
- priority-l ::   The priority letter if any was given
- priority-n ::  The computed numerical priority

{{{noindent}}} Time and date will only be given if a timestamp (or
deadline/scheduled) led to the selection of the item.

A CSV list like this is very easy to use in a post-processing script.
For example, here is a Perl program that gets the TODO list from
Emacs/Org and prints all the items, preceded by a checkbox:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src perl
#!/usr/bin/perl

# define the Emacs command to run
$cmd = "emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -eval '(org-batch-agenda-csv \"t\")'";

# run it and capture the output
$agenda = qx@{$cmd 2>/dev/null@};

# loop over all lines
foreach $line (split(/\n/,$agenda)) @{
  # get the individual values
  ($category,$head,$type,$todo,$tags,$date,$time,$extra,
   $priority_l,$priority_n) = split(/,/,$line);
  # process and print
  print "[ ] $head\n";
@}

** Using the property API
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Writing programs that use entry properties
   :END:
#+cindex: API, for properties
#+cindex: properties, API

Here is a description of the functions that can be used to work with
properties.

#+attr_texinfo: :options org-entry-properties &optional pom which
#+begin_defun
Get all properties of the entry at point-or-marker POM.
This includes the TODO keyword, the tags, time strings for deadline,
scheduled, and clocking, and any additional properties defined in the
entry.  The return value is an alist.  Keys may occur multiple times
if the property key was used several times.@*
POM may also be nil, in which case the current entry is used.
If WHICH is nil or `all', get all properties.  If WHICH is
`special' or `standard', only get that subclass.
#+end_defun

#+vindex: org-use-property-inheritance
#+findex: org-insert-property-drawer
#+attr_texinfo: :options org-entry-get pom property &optional inherit
#+begin_defun
Get value of PROPERTY for entry at point-or-marker POM.  By default,
this only looks at properties defined locally in the entry.  If INHERIT
is non-nil and the entry does not have the property, then also check
higher levels of the hierarchy.  If INHERIT is the symbol
~selective~, use inheritance if and only if the setting of
~org-use-property-inheritance~ selects PROPERTY for inheritance.
#+end_defun

#+attr_texinfo: :options org-entry-delete pom property
#+begin_defun
Delete the property PROPERTY from entry at point-or-marker POM.
#+end_defun

#+attr_texinfo: :options org-entry-put pom property value
#+begin_defun
Set PROPERTY to VALUE for entry at point-or-marker POM.
#+end_defun

#+attr_texinfo: :options org-buffer-property-keys &optional include-specials
#+begin_defun
Get all property keys in the current buffer.
#+end_defun
#+attr_texinfo: :options org-insert-property-drawer
#+begin_defun
Insert a property drawer for the current entry.  Also
#+end_defun

#+attr_texinfo: :options org-entry-put-multivalued-property pom property &rest values
#+begin_defun
Set PROPERTY at point-or-marker POM to VALUES.  VALUES should be a list of
strings.  They will be concatenated, with spaces as separators.
#+end_defun

#+attr_texinfo: :options org-entry-get-multivalued-property pom property
#+begin_defun
Treat the value of the property PROPERTY as a whitespace-separated list of
values and return the values as a list of strings.
#+end_defun

#+attr_texinfo: :options org-entry-add-to-multivalued-property pom property value
#+begin_defun
Treat the value of the property PROPERTY as a whitespace-separated list of
values and make sure that VALUE is in this list.
#+end_defun

#+attr_texinfo: :options org-entry-remove-from-multivalued-property pom property value
#+begin_defun
Treat the value of the property PROPERTY as a whitespace-separated list of
values and make sure that VALUE is /not/ in this list.
#+end_defun

#+attr_texinfo: :options org-entry-member-in-multivalued-property pom property value
#+begin_defun
Treat the value of the property PROPERTY as a whitespace-separated list of
values and check if VALUE is in this list.
#+end_defun

#+attr_texinfo: :options org-property-allowed-value-functions
#+begin_defopt
Hook for functions supplying allowed values for a specific property.
The functions must take a single argument, the name of the property, and
return a flat list of allowed values.  If {{{samp(:ETC)}}} is one of
the values, use the values as completion help, but allow also other values
to be entered.  The functions must return ~nil~ if they are not
responsible for this property.
#+end_defopt

** Using the mapping API
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Mapping over all or selected entries
   :END:
#+cindex: API, for mapping
#+cindex: mapping entries, API

Org has sophisticated mapping capabilities to find all entries satisfying
certain criteria.  Internally, this functionality is used to produce agenda
views, but there is also an API that can be used to execute arbitrary
functions for each or selected entries.  The main entry point for this API
is:

#+attr_texinfo: :options org-map-entries func &optional match scope &rest skip
#+begin_defun
Call FUNC at each headline selected by MATCH in SCOPE.

FUNC is a function or a Lisp form.  The function will be called without
arguments, with the cursor positioned at the beginning of the headline.
The return values of all calls to the function will be collected and
returned as a list.

The call to FUNC will be wrapped into a save-excursion form, so FUNC
does not need to preserve point.  After evaluation, the cursor will be
moved to the end of the line (presumably of the headline of the
processed entry) and search continues from there.  Under some
circumstances, this may not produce the wanted results.  For example,
if you have removed (e.g., archived) the current (sub)tree it could
mean that the next entry will be skipped entirely.  In such cases, you
can specify the position from where search should continue by making
FUNC set the variable `org-map-continue-from' to the desired buffer
position.

MATCH is a tags/property/todo match as it is used in the agenda match view.
Only headlines that are matched by this query will be considered during
the iteration.  When MATCH is nil or t, all headlines will be
visited by the iteration.

SCOPE determines the scope of this command.  It can be any of:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @code
- nil ::     

  The current buffer, respecting the restriction, if any.

- tree ::    

  The subtree started with the entry at point.

- region ::  

  The entries within the active region, if any.

- file ::    

  The current buffer, without restriction.

- file-with-archives ::
        
  The current buffer, and any archives associated with it.

- agenda ::  

  All agenda files.

- agenda-with-archives ::
        
  All agenda files with any archive files associated with them.

- (file1 file2 ...) ::
        
  If this is a list, all files in the list will be scanned.


{{{noindent}}} The remaining args are treated as settings for the
skipping facilities of the scanner.  The following items can be given
here:

#+vindex: org-agenda-skip-function
#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- ~archive~ ::   

  Skip trees with the archive tag.

- ~comment~ ::   

  Skip trees with the COMMENT keyword.

- function or Lisp form ::

  Will be used as value for ~org-agenda-skip-function~, so whenever the
  function returns t, FUNC will not be called for that entry and search
  will continue from the point where the function leaves it.
#+end_defun

The function given to that mapping routine can really do anything you like.
It can use the property API (see [[Using the property API]]) to gather more
information about the entry, or in order to change metadata in the entry.
Here are a few functions that might be handy:

#+attr_texinfo: :options org-todo &optional arg
#+begin_defun
Change the TODO state of the entry.  See the docstring of the functions for
the many possible values for the argument ARG.
#+end_defun

#+attr_texinfo: :options org-priority &optional action
#+begin_defun
Change the priority of the entry.  See the docstring of this function for the
possible values for ACTION.
#+end_defun

#+attr_texinfo: :options org-toggle-tag tag &optional onoff
#+begin_defun
Toggle the tag TAG in the current entry.  Setting ONOFF to either ~on~
or ~off~ will not toggle tag, but ensure that it is either on or off.
#+end_defun

#+attr_texinfo: :options org-promote
#+begin_defun
Promote the current entry.
#+end_defun

#+attr_texinfo: :options org-demote
#+begin_defun
Demote the current entry.
#+end_defun

The following simple example will turn all entries in the current file
with a tag ~TOMORROW~ into TODO entries with the keyword ~UPCOMING~.
Entries in comment trees and in archive trees will be ignored.

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-map-entries
   '(org-todo "UPCOMING")
   "+TOMORROW" 'file 'archive 'comment)
#+end_src

The following example counts the number of entries with TODO keyword
~WAITING~, in all agenda files.

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(length (org-map-entries t "/+WAITING" 'agenda))
#+end_src

* MobileOrg
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: Viewing and capture on a mobile device
  :APPENDIX:    Appendix
  :END:
#+cindex: iPhone
#+cindex: MobileOrg
#+cindex: Moreland, Richard
#+cindex: Jones, Matt

MobileOrg is the name of the mobile companion app for Org mode,
currently available for iOS and for Android.  MobileOrg offers
offline viewing and capture support for an Org mode system rooted on a
``real'' computer.  It does also allow you to record changes to
existing entries.  The [[http://mobileorg.ncogni.to/][iOS implementation]] for the iPhone/iPod
Touch/iPad series of devices, was developed by Richard Moreland.
Android users should check out [[http://wiki.github.com/matburt/mobileorg-android/][MobileOrg Android]] by Matt Jones.  The
two implementations are not identical but offer similar features.

This appendix describes the support Org has for creating agenda views
in a format that can be displayed by MobileOrg, and for integrating
notes captured and changes made by MobileOrg into the main system.

For changing tags and TODO states in MobileOrg, you should have set up
the customization variables ~org-todo-keywords~ and ~org-tags-alist~
to cover all important tags and TODO keywords, even if individual
files use only part of these.  MobileOrg will also offer you states and
tags set up with in-buffer settings, but it will understand the
logistics of TODO state /sets/ (see [[Per-file keywords]]) and /mutually
exclusive/ tags (see [[Setting tags]]) only for those set in these
variables.

** Setting up the staging area
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Where to interact with the mobile device
   :END:

MobileOrg needs to interact with Emacs through a directory on a
server.  If you are using a public server, you should consider to
encrypt the files that are uploaded to the server.  This can be done
with Org mode 7.02 and with MobileOrg 1.5 (iPhone version), and you
need an {{{file(openssl)}}} installation on your system.  To turn on
encryption, set a password in MobileOrg and, on the Emacs side,
configure the variable ~org-mobile-use-encryption~.[fn:164]

The easiest way to create that directory is to use a free [[http://dropbox.com][Dropbox]]
account.[fn:165] When MobileOrg first connects to your Dropbox, it
will create a directory MobileOrg inside the Dropbox.  After the
directory has been created, tell Emacs about it:

#+header: :eval no
#+header: :exports code
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-mobile-directory "~/Dropbox/MobileOrg")
#+end_src

Org mode has commands to put files for MobileOrg into that
directory, and to read captured notes from there.

** Pushing to MobileOrg
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Uploading Org files and agendas
   :END:

This operation copies all files currently listed in ~org-mobile-files~
to the directory ~org-mobile-directory~.  By default this list contains
all agenda files (as listed in ~org-agenda-files~), but additional
files can be included by customizing ~org-mobile-files~.  File names
will be staged with paths relative to ~org-directory~, so all files
should be inside this directory.[fn:184]

The push operation also creates a special Org file
{{{file(agendas.org)}}} with all custom agenda view defined by the
user.[fn:166]

Finally, Org writes the file {{{file(index.org)}}}, containing links
to all other files.  MobileOrg first reads this file from the server,
and then downloads all agendas and Org files listed in it.  To speed up
the download, MobileOrg will only read files whose checksums have
changed.[fn:167]

** Pulling from MobileOrg
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DESCRIPTION: Integrating captured and flagged items
   :END:

When MobileOrg synchronizes with the server, it not only pulls the
Org files for viewing.  It also appends captured entries and pointers
to flagged and changed entries to the file {{{file(mobileorg.org)}}}
on the server.  Org has a /pull/ operation that integrates this
information into an inbox file and operates on the pointers to flagged
entries.  Here is how it works:

1. Org moves all entries found in {{{file(mobileorg.org)}}} and
   appends them to the file pointed to by the variable
   ~org-mobile-inbox-for-pull~.[fn:168] Each captured entry and each
   editing event will be a top-level entry in the inbox file.

2. After moving the entries, Org will attempt to implement the changes
   made in MobileOrg.  Some changes are applied directly and without
   user interaction.  Examples are all changes to tags, TODO state,
   headline and body text that can be cleanly applied.  Entries that
   have been flagged for further action will receive a tag
   ~:FLAGGED:~, so that they can be easily found again.  When there is
   a problem finding an entry or applying the change, the pointer
   entry will remain in the inbox and will be marked with an error
   message.  You need to later resolve these issues by hand.

3. Org will then generate an agenda view with all flagged entries.  The
   user should then go through these entries and do whatever actions
   are necessary.  If a note has been stored while flagging an entry in
   MobileOrg, that note will be displayed in the echo area when the
   cursor is on the corresponding agenda line.

   #+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
   - {{{kbd(?)}}} ::
     #+kindex: ?

     Pressing {{{kbd(?)}}} in that special agenda will display the full
     flagging note in another window and also push it onto the kill ring.
     So you could use {{{kbd(? z C-y C-c C-c)}}} to store that flagging
     note as a normal note in the entry.  Pressing {{{kbd(?)}}} twice in
     succession will offer to remove the ~:FLAGGED:~ tag along with the
     recorded flagging note (which is stored in a property).  In this way
     you indicate that the intended processing for this flagged entry is
     finished.


#+kindex: C-c a ?

If you are not able to process all flagged entries directly, you can always
return to this agenda view using {{{kbd(C-c a ?)}}}.[fn:169]

* History and acknowledgments
  :PROPERTIES:
  :DESCRIPTION: How Org came into being
  :ALT_TITLE: History and Acknowledgments
  :APPENDIX:    Appendix
  :END:
** From Carsten

Org was born in 2003, out of frustration over the user interface of
the Emacs Outline mode.  I was trying to organize my notes and
projects, and using Emacs seemed to be the natural way to go.  However,
having to remember eleven different commands with two or three keys
per command, only to hide and show parts of the outline tree, that
seemed entirely unacceptable to me.  Also, when using outlines to take
notes, I constantly wanted to restructure the tree, organizing it
parallel to my thoughts and plans.  /Visibility cycling/ and /structure
editing/ were originally implemented in the package
{{{file(outline-magic.el)}}}, but quickly moved to the more general
{{{file(org.el)}}}.  As this environment became comfortable for project
planning, the next step was adding /TODO entries/, basic /timestamps/,
and /table support/.  These areas highlighted the two main goals that
Org still has today: to be a new, outline-based, plain text mode with
innovative and intuitive editing features, and to incorporate project
planning functionality directly into a notes file.

Since the first release, literally thousands of emails to me or to the
[[mailto:emacs-orgmode@gnu.org][mailing list]] have provided a constant stream of bug reports, feedback,
new ideas, and sometimes patches and add-on code.  Many thanks to
everyone who has helped to improve this package.  I am trying to keep
here a list of the people who had significant influence in shaping one
or more aspects of Org.  The list may not be complete, if I have
forgotten someone, please accept my apologies and let me know.

Before I get to this list, a few special mentions are in order:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- Bastien Guerry ::

  Bastien has written a large number of extensions to Org (most of them
  integrated into the core by now), including the LaTeX exporter and
  the plain list parser.  His support during the early days, when he
  basically acted as co-maintainer, was central to the success of this
  project.  Bastien also invented Worg, helped establishing the Web
  presence of Org, and sponsored hosting costs for the ~orgmode.org~
  website.

- Eric Schulte and Dan Davison ::

  Eric and Dan are jointly responsible for the Org-babel system, which
  turns Org into a multi-language environment for evaluating code and
  doing literate programming and reproducible research.

- John Wiegley ::

  John has contributed a number of great ideas and patches directly to
  Org, including the attachment system ({{{file(org-attach.el)}}}),
  integration with Apple Mail ({{{file(org-mac-message.el)}}}),
  hierarchical dependencies of TODO items, habit tracking
  ({{{file(org-habits.el)}}}), and encryption
  ({{{file(org-crypt.el)}}}).  Also, the capture system is really an
  extended copy of his great {{{file(remember.el)}}}.

- Sebastian Rose ::

  Without Sebastian, the HTML/XHTML publishing of Org would be the
  pitiful work of an ignorant amateur.  Sebastian has pushed this part of
  Org onto a much higher level.  He also wrote {{{file(org-info.js)}}}, a
  Java script for displaying webpages derived from Org using an
  Info-like or a folding interface with single-key navigation.


{{{noindent}}} See [[List of contributions][below]] for the full list of contributions! Again,
please let me know what I am missing here!

** From Bastien

I (Bastien) have been maintaining Org since January 2011.  This
appendix would not be complete without adding a few more
acknowledgements and thanks to Carsten's ones above.

I am first grateful to Carsten for his trust while handing me over the
maintainership of Org.  His support as been great since day one of this
new adventure, and it helped a lot.

When I took over maintainership, I knew I would have to make Org more
collaborative than ever, as I would have to rely on people that are
more knowledgeable than I am on many parts of the code.  Here is a list
of the persons I could rely on, they should really be considered
co-maintainers, either of the code or the community:

#+attr_texinfo: :table-type table :indic @asis
- Eric Schulte ::

  Eric is maintaining the Babel parts of Org.  His reactivity here kept
  me away from worrying about possible bugs here and let me focus on
  other parts.

- Nicolas Goaziou ::

  Nicolas is maintaining the consistency of the deepest parts of Org.
  His work on {{{file(org-element.el)}}} and {{{file(org-export.el)}}}
  has been outstanding, and opened the doors for many new ideas and
  features.

- Jambunathan K ::

  Jambunathan contributed the ODT exporter, definitly a killer feature
  of Org mode.  He also contributed the new HTML exporter, which is
  another core feature of Org.  Here too, I knew I could rely on him to
  fix bugs in these areas and to patiently explain the users what was
  the problems and solutions.

- Achim Gratz ::

  Achim rewrote the building process of Org, turning some /ad hoc/ tools
  into a flexible and conceptually clean process.  He patiently coped
  with the many hicups that such a change can create for users.

- Nick Dokos ::

  The Org mode mailing list would not be such a nice place without Nick,
  who patiently helped users so many times.  It is impossible to
  overestimate such a great help, and the list would not be so active
  without him.


I received support from so many users that it is clearly impossible to be
fair when shortlisting a few of them---but Org's history would not be
complete if the ones above were not mentioned in this manual.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] The iCalendar file will contain TODO and agenda items only.

[fn:2] If your Emacs distribution does not come with Org,
the function ~org-version~ will not be defined.

[fn:3] The ~master~ branch is where development takes place.

[fn:4] The output from install-info (if any) is system dependent.  In
particular, Debian and its derivatives use two different versions of
install-info.  You may safely ignore the message:
#+begin_example
   This is not dpkg install-info anymore, but GNU install-info
   See the man page for ginstall-info for command line arguments
#+end_example
returned by install-info.

[fn:5] If you don't use font-lock globally, turn it on in an Org
buffer with ~(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)~.

[fn:6] Please consider subscribing to the mailing list in order to
minimize the work the mailing list moderators have to do.

[fn:7] Easy templates insert lowercase keywords and Babel dynamically
inserts ~#+results~.

[fn:8] See the variables ~org-special-ctrl-a/e~, ~org-special-ctrl-k~,
and ~org-ctrl-k-protect-subtree~ to configure special behavior of
{{{kbd(C-a)}}}, {{{kbd(C-e)}}}, and {{{kbd(C-k)}}} in headlines.  Note
also that clocking only works with headings indented less than 30
stars.

[fn:9] See the option ~org-cycle-global-at-bob~.

[fn:10] The indirect buffer will contain the entire buffer, but will
be narrowed to the current tree.  Editing the indirect buffer will also
change the original buffer, but without affecting visibility in that
buffer.  For more information about indirect buffers,
[[info:emacs:Indirect Buffers][GNU Emacs Manual]].

[fn:11] If you do not want the line to be split, customize the
variable ~org-M-RET-may-split-line~.

[fn:12] See also the variables ~org-show-hierarchy-above~,
~org-show-following-heading~, ~org-show-siblings~, and
~org-show-entry-below~ for detailed control on how much context is
shown around each match.

[fn:13] This depends on the option ~org-remove-highlights-with-change~.

[fn:14] This does not work under XEmacs, because XEmacs uses selective
display for outlining, not text properties.

[fn:15] When using ~*~ as a bullet, lines must be indented or they will
be seen as top-level headlines.  Also, when you are hiding leading
stars to get a clean outline view, plain list items starting with a
star may be hard to distinguish from true headlines.  In short: even
though ~*~ is supported, it may be better to not use it for plain list
items.

[fn:16] You can filter out any of them by configuring
~org-plain-list-ordered-item-terminator~.

[fn:17] If there's a checkbox in the item, the cookie must be put
_before_ the checkbox.  If you have activated alphabetical lists, you
can also use counters like ~[@b]~.

[fn:18] Org only changes the filling settings for Emacs.  For XEmacs,
you should use Kyle E.  Jones' {{{file(filladapt.el)}}}.

[fn:19] If you do not want the item to be split, customize the
variable ~org-M-RET-may-split-line~.

[fn:20] If you want to cycle around items that way, you may customize
~org-list-use-circular-motion~.

[fn:21] See ~org-list-use-circular-motion~ for a cyclic behavior.

[fn:24] Centering does not work inside Emacs, but it does have an
effect when exporting to HTML.

[fn:26] For backward compatibility you can also use special names like
~$LR5~ and ~$LR12~ to refer in a stable way to the fifth and twelfth
field in the last row of the table.  However, this syntax is
deprecated, it should not be used for new documents.  Use ~@>$~
instead.

[fn:25] Org will understand references typed by the user as
{{{samp(B4)}}}, but it will not use this syntax when offering a
formula for editing.  You can customize this behavior using the
variable ~org-table-use-standard-references~.

[fn:22] To insert a vertical bar into a table field, use ~\vert~ or,
inside a word ~abc\vert{}def~.

[fn:23] This feature does not work on XEmacs.

[fn:27] The computation time scales as O(N^2) because table FOO is
parsed for each field to be copied.

[fn:28] The {{{file(calc)}}} package has the non-standard
convention that ~/~ has lower precedence than ~*~, so that ~a/b*c~ is
interpreted as ~a/(b*c)~.

[fn:29] The ~printf~ reformatting is limited in precision because the
value passed to it is converted into an ~integer~ or ~double~.  The
~integer~ is limited in size by truncating the signed value to 32
bits.  The ~double~ is limited in precision to 64 bits overall which
leaves approximately 16 significant decimal digits.

[fn:30] Such names must start with an alphabetic character and use
only alphanumeric/underscore characters.

[fn:31] Note that text before the first headline is usually not
exported, so the first such target should be after the first headline,
or in the line directly before the first headline.

[fn:32] To insert a link targeting a headline, in-buffer completion
can be used.  Just type a star followed by a few optional letters into
the buffer and press {{{kbdkey(M-,TAB)}}}.  All headlines in the
current buffer will be offered as completions.

[fn:33] The actual behavior of the search will depend on the value of
the variable ~org-link-search-must-match-exact-headline~.  If its value
is ~nil~, then a fuzzy text search will be done.  If it is ~t~, then
only the exact headline will be matched.  If the value is
{{{samp('query-to-create)}}}, then an exact headline will be searched;
if it is not found, then the user will be queried to create it.

[fn:34] If the headline contains a timestamp, it will be removed from
the link and result in a wrong link -- you should avoid putting a
timestamp in the headline.

[fn:35] Note that you don't have to use this command to insert a link.
Links in Org are plain text, and you can type or paste them straight
into the buffer.  By using this command, the links are automatically
enclosed in double brackets, and you will be asked for the optional
descriptive text.

[fn:36] After insertion of a stored link, the link will be removed
from the list of stored links.  To keep it in the list later use, use a
triple {{{kbd(C-u)}}} prefix argument to {{{kbd(C-c C-l)}}}, or
configure the option ~org-keep-stored-link-after-insertion~.

[fn:37] This works if a function has been defined in the ~:complete~
property of a link in ~org-link-parameters~.

[fn:38] See the variable ~org-display-internal-link-with-indirect-buffer~.

[fn:44] Check also the variable ~org-fast-tag-selection-include-todo~,
it allows you to change the TODO state through the tags interface
([[Setting tags]]), in case you like to mingle the two concepts.  Note that
this means you need to come up with unique keys across both sets of
keywords.

[fn:39] For backward compatibility, line numbers can also follow a
single colon.

[fn:40] Of course, you can make a document that contains only long
lists of TODO items, but this is not required.

[fn:41] Changing the variable ~org-todo-keywords~ only becomes
effective after restarting Org mode in a buffer.

[fn:42] This is also true for the {{{kbd(t)}}} command in the timeline
and agenda buffers.

[fn:43] All characters are allowed except ~@^!~, which have a special
meaning here.

[fn:45] Org mode parses these lines only when Org mode is activated
after visiting a file.  {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} with the cursor in a line
starting with {{{samp(#+)}}} is simply restarting Org mode for the
current buffer.

[fn:46] The corresponding in-buffer setting is: ~#+STARTUP: logdone~.

[fn:47] The corresponding in-buffer setting is: ~#+STARTUP: lognotedone~.

[fn:48] See the variable ~org-log-states-order-reversed~.

[fn:54] {{{kbd(C-u C-c C-c)}}} on the /first/ item of a list with no
checkbox will add checkboxes to the rest of the list.

[fn:49] It is possible that Org mode will record two timestamps when
you are using both ~org-log-done~ and state change logging.  However,
it will never prompt for two notes---if you have configured both, the
state change recording note will take precedence and cancel the
{{{samp(Closing Note)}}}.

[fn:50] See also the option ~org-priority-start-cycle-with-default~.

[fn:51] To keep subtasks out of the global TODO list, see the
~org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels~.

[fn:52] With the exception of description lists.  But you can allow it
by modifying ~org-list-automatic-rules~ accordingly.

[fn:53] Set the variable ~org-hierarchical-checkbox-statistics~ if you
want such cookies to count all checkboxes below the cookie, not just
those belonging to direct children.

[fn:55] As with all these in-buffer settings, pressing 
{{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} activates any changes in the line.

[fn:56] This is only true if the search does not involve more complex
tests including properties (see [[Property searches]]).

[fn:57] Keys will automatically be assigned to tags that have no
configured keys.

[fn:58] Please note that the COLUMNS definition must be on a single
line---it is wrapped here only because of formatting constraints.

[fn:59] Contributed packages are not part of Emacs, but are
distributed with the main distribution of Org (visit
[[https://orgmode.org]]).

[fn:60] The Org date format is inspired by the standard ISO 8601
date/time format.  To use an alternative format, see [[Custom time
format]].  The day name is optional when you type the date yourself.
However, any dates inserted or modified by Org will add that day name,
for reading convenience.

[fn:61] When working with the standard diary sexp functions, you need
to be very careful with the order of the arguments.  That order depends
evilly on the variable ~calendar-date-style~ (or, for older Emacs
versions, ~european-calendar-style~).  For example, to specify a date
December 12, 2005, the call might look like ~(diary-date 12 1 2005)~
or ~(diary-date 1 12 2005)~ or ~(diary-date 2005 12 1)~, depending on
the settings.  This has been the source of much confusion.  Org mode
users can resort to special versions of these functions like
~org-date~ or ~org-anniversary~.  These work just like the
corresponding ~diary-~ functions, but with stable ISO order of
arguments (year, month, day) wherever applicable, independent of the
value of ~calendar-date-style~.

[fn:62] See the variable ~org-read-date-prefer-future~.  You may
set that variable to the symbol ~time~ to even make a time before now
shift the date to tomorrow.

[fn:63] If you don't need/want the calendar, configure the variable
~org-popup-calendar-for-date-prompt~.

[fn:64] If you find this distracting, turn off the display with
~org-read-date-display-live~.

[fn:65] It will still be listed on that date after it has been marked
DONE.  If you don't like this, set the variable
~org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done~.

[fn:66] The {{{samp(SCHEDULED)}}} and {{{samp(DEADLINE)}}} dates are
inserted on the line right below the headline.  Don't put any text
between this line and the headline.

[fn:67] Note the corresponding ~#+STARTUP~ keywords ~logredeadline~,
~lognoteredeadline~, and ~nologredeadline~.

[fn:68] Note the corresponding ~#+STARTUP~ keywords ~logreschedule~,
~lognotereschedule~, and ~nologreschedule~.

[fn:69] In fact, the target state is taken from, in this sequence, the
~REPEAT_TO_STATE~ property or the variable ~org-todo-repeat-to-state~.
If neither of these is specified, the target state defaults to the
first state of the TODO state sequence.

[fn:70] You can change this using the option ~org-log-repeat~, or the
~#+STARTUP~ options ~logrepeat~, ~lognoterepeat~, and ~nologrepeat~.
With ~lognoterepeat~, you will also be prompted for a note.

[fn:71] Clocking only works if all headings are indented with less
than 30 stars.  This is a hardcoded limitation of ~lmax~ in
~org-clock-sum~.

[fn:72] To resume the clock under the assumption that you have worked
on this task while outside Emacs, use ~(setq org-clock-persist t)~.

[fn:73] To add an effort estimate ``on the fly'', hook a function
doing this to ~org-clock-in-prepare-hook~.

[fn:74] The last reset of the task is recorded by the ~LAST_REPEAT~
property.

[fn:75] See also the variable ~org-clock-modeline-total~.

[fn:76] The corresponding in-buffer setting is: 
~#+STARTUP: lognoteclock-out~.

[fn:77] Language terms can be set through the variable
~org-clock-clocktable-language-setup~.

[fn:78] Note that all parameters must be specified in a single
line---the line is broken here only to fit it into the manual.

[fn:79] On computers using Mac OS X, idleness is based on actual user
idleness, not just Emacs' idle time.  For X11, you can install a
utility program {{{file(x11idle.c)}}}, available in the
~contrib/scripts~ directory of the Org git distribution, to get the
same general treatment of idleness.  On other systems, idle time refers
to Emacs idle time only.

[fn:80] You may change the property being used with the variable
~org-effort-property~.

[fn:86] Note the corresponding ~#+STARTUP~ keywords ~logrefile~,
~lognoterefile~, and ~nologrefile~.

[fn:81] Please select your own key, {{{kbd(C-c c)}}} is only a
suggestion.

[fn:82] If you need one of these sequences literally, escape the
{{{kbd(%)}}} with a backslash.

[fn:83] If you define your own link types (see [[Adding hyperlink
types]]), any property you store with ~org-store-link-props~ can be
accessed in capture templates in a similar way.

[fn:84] This will always be the other, not the user.  See the variable
~org-from-is-user-regexp~.

[fn:85] If you move entries or Org files from one directory to
another, you may want to configure ~org-attach-directory~ to contain
an absolute path.

[fn:87] For backward compatibility, the following also works: If there
are several such lines in a file, each specifies the archive location
for the text below it.  The first such line also applies to any text
before its definition.  However, using this method is /strongly/
deprecated as it is incompatible with the outline structure of the
document.  The correct method for setting multiple archive locations in
a buffer is using properties.

[fn:94] Only tags filtering will be respected here, effort filtering
is ignored.

[fn:88] When using the dispatcher, pressing {{{kbd(<)}}} before
selecting a command will actually limit the command to the current
file, and ignore ~org-agenda-files~ until the next dispatcher command.

[fn:89] For backward compatibility, you can also press {{{kbd(1)}}} to
restrict to the current buffer.

[fn:90] For backward compatibility, you can also press {{{kbd(0)}}} to
restrict to the current region/subtree.

[fn:91] For backward compatibility, the universal prefix
{{{kbd(C-u)}}} causes all TODO entries to be listed before the agenda.
This feature is deprecated, use the dedicated TODO list, or a block
agenda instead (see [[Block agenda]]).

[fn:92] But see [[x-agenda-skip-entry-regexp][skipping entries based on regexp]].

[fn:93] For backward compatibility, the following also works: if
there are several such lines in a file, each specifies the category
for the text below it.  The first category also applies to any text
before the first CATEGORY line.  However, using this method is
/strongly/ deprecated as it is incompatible with the outline structure
of the document.  The correct method for setting multiple categories in
a buffer is using a property.

[fn:95] Custom commands can preset a filter by binding the variable
~org-agenda-tag-filter-preset~ as an option.  This filter will then be
applied to the view and persist as a basic filter through refreshes
and more secondary filtering.  The filter is a global property of the
entire agenda view---in a block agenda, you should only set this in
the global options section, not in the section of an individual block.

[fn:96] You can also create persistent custom functions through
~org-agenda-bulk-custom-functions~.

[fn:97] The Emacs diary file is parsed for the agenda when
~org-agenda-include-diary~ is set.

[fn:98] You can provide a description for a prefix key by inserting a
cons cell with the prefix and the description.

[fn:99] For HTML you need to install Hrvoje Niksic's
{{{file(htmlize.el)}}}.  To create PDF output, the ghostscript
{{{file(ps2pdf)}}} utility must be installed on the system.  Selecting
a PDF file will also create the postscript file.

[fn:100] If you want to store standard views like the weekly agenda or
the global TODO list as well, you need to define custom commands for
them in order to be able to specify file names.

[fn:101] Quoting depends on the system you use, please check the FAQ
for examples.

[fn:102] This works automatically for the HTML backend (it requires
version 1.34 of the {{{file(htmlize.el)}}} package, which is
distributed with Org).  Fontified code chunks in LaTeX can be
achieved using either the listings package or the [[http://code.google.com/p/minted][minted]] package.
Refer to ~org-export-latex-listings~ documentation for details.

[fn:103] Code in {{{samp(src)}}} blocks may also be evaluated either
interactively or on export.  See [[Working with source code]] for more
information on evaluating code blocks.

[fn:104] Adding ~-k~ to ~-n -r~ will /keep/ the labels in the source
code while using line numbers for the links, which might be useful to
explain those in an Org mode example code.

[fn:105] Upon exit, lines starting with {{{samp(*)}}}, {{{samp(\,*)}}},
{{{samp(#+)}}} and {{{samp(\,#+)}}} will get a comma prepended, to keep
them from being interpreted by Org as outline nodes or special syntax.
These commas will be stripped for editing with {{{kbd(C-c ')}}}, and
also for export.

[fn:106] You may select a different-mode with the variable
~org-edit-fixed-width-region-mode~.

[fn:107] LaTeX is a macro system based on Donald\nbsp{}E.\nbsp{}Knuth's TeX
system.  Many of the features described here as LaTeX are really
from TeX, but for simplicity I am blurring this distinction.

[fn:108] You can turn this on by default by setting the variable
~org-pretty-entities~, or on a per-file base with the ~#+STARTUP~
option ~entitiespretty~.

[fn:109] If you plan to use this regularly or on pages with
significant page views, you should install {{{file(MathJax)}}} on your
own server in order to limit the load of our server.

[fn:110] For this to work you need to be on a system with a working
LaTeX installation.  You also need the {{{file(dvipng)}}} program or
the {{{file(convert)}}}, respectively available at
[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/dvipng/]] and from the
{{{file(ImageMagick)}}} suite.  The LaTeX header that will be used
when processing a fragment can be configured with the variable
~org-format-latex-header~.

[fn:111] When {{{file(MathJax)}}} is used, only the environment
recognized by {{{file(MathJax)}}} will be processed.  When
{{{file(dvipng)}}} is used to create images, any LaTeX environments
will be handled.

[fn:112] Org mode has a method to test if the cursor is inside such a
fragment, see the documentation of the function
~org-inside-LaTeX-fragment-p~.

[fn:113] The variable ~org-export-date-timestamp-format~ defines how
this timestamp will be exported.

[fn:114] If you want to configure many options this way, you can use
several ~#+OPTIONS~ lines.

[fn:115] To make this behavior the default, customize the variable
~org-export-run-in-background~.

[fn:116] This requires ~transient-mark-mode~ be turned on.

[fn:117] To select the current subtree, use {{{kbd(C-c @)}}}.

[fn:118] This requires ~transient-mark-mode~ be turned on.

[fn:119] To select the current subtree, use {{{kbd(C-c @)}}}.

[fn:120] But see the variable ~org-export-html-inline-images~.

[fn:121] If you plan to use this regularly or on pages with
significant page views, you should install MathJax on your own server
in order to limit the load of our server.  Installation instructions
can be found on the MathJax website, see
[[http://www.mathjax.org/resources/docs/?installation.html]].

[fn:122] If the classes on TODO keywords and tags lead to conflicts,
use the variables ~org-export-html-todo-kwd-class-prefix~ and
~org-export-html-tag-class-prefix~ to make them unique.

[fn:123] This style is defined in the constant
~org-export-html-style-default~, which you should not modify.  To turn
inclusion of these defaults off, customize
~org-export-html-style-include-default~.

[fn:124] The default LaTeX output is designed for processing with
~pdftex~ or LaTeX.  It includes packages that are not compatible
with ~xetex~ and possibly ~luatex~.  See the variables
~org-export-latex-default-packages-alist~ and
~org-export-latex-packages-alist~.

[fn:125] This requires ~transient-mark-mode~ be turned on.

[fn:126] To select the current subtree, use {{{kbd(C-c @)}}}.

[fn:127] Into which the values of
~org-export-latex-default-packages-alist~ and
~org-export-latex-packages-alist~ are spliced.

[fn:128] One can also take advantage of this option to pass other,
unrelated options into the figure or table environment.  For an example
see the section ``Exporting org files'' in
[[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-hacks.html]].

[fn:129] This requires ~transient-mark-mode~ to be turned on.

[fn:130] To select the current subtree, use {{{kbd(C-c @)}}}.

[fn:131] ODT export was added in Org mode version 7.8.

[fn:132] See [[http://docs.oasis-open.org/office/v1.2/OpenDocument-v1.2.html][Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument)
Version 1.2]].

[fn:133] This requires ~transient-mark-mode~ to be turned on.

[fn:134] To select the current subtree, use {{{kbd(C-c @)}}}.

[fn:135] The column widths are interpreted as weighted ratios with the
default weight being 1.

[fn:136] Use of {{{file(ImageMagick)}}} is only desirable.  However, if
you routinely produce documents that have large images or you export
your Org files that has images using a Emacs batch script, then the
use of {{{file(ImageMagick)}}} is mandatory.

[fn:137] See [[http://www.mathtoweb.com/cgi-bin/mathtoweb_home.pl][MathToWeb]].

[fn:138] Your {{{file(htmlfontify.el)}}} library must at least be at
Emacs 24.1 levels for fontification to be turned on.

[fn:139] See [[http://docs.oasis-open.org/office/v1.2/OpenDocument-v1.2.html][OpenDocument-v1.2 Specification]].

[fn:140] See the ~<table:table-template>~ element of the
OpenDocument-v1.2 specification.

[fn:141] See the attributes ~table:template-name~,
~table:use-first-row-styles~, ~table:use-last-row-styles~,
~table:use-first-column-styles~, ~table:use-last-column-styles~,
~table:use-banding-rows-styles~, and ~table:use-banding-column-styles~
of the ~<table:table>~ element in the OpenDocument-v1.2 specification.

[fn:142] Note that {{{file(.odt)}}} files are {{{samp(zip)}}}
archives.

[fn:143] See the variables ~org-icalendar-use-deadline~ and
~org-icalendar-use-scheduled~.

[fn:144] To add inherited tags or the TODO state, configure the
variable ~org-icalendar-categories~.

[fn:145] The LOCATION property can be inherited from higher in the
hierarchy if you configure ~org-use-property-inheritance~ accordingly.

[fn:146] The files {{{file(file-source.org)}}} and
{{{file(file-source.org.html)}}} if source and publishing directories
are equal.  Note that with this kind of setup, you need to add
~:exclude "-source\\.org"~ to the project definition in
~org-publish-project-alist~ to prevent the published source files from
being considered as new org files the next time the project is
published.

[fn:147] Note that {{{samp(src)}}} blocks may be inserted using Org
mode's [[Easy templates]] system.

[fn:148] Whenever code is evaluated there is a potential for that code
to do harm.  Org mode provides safeguards to ensure that code is only
evaluated after explicit confirmation from the user.  For information
on these safeguards (and on how to disable them) see [[Code evaluation
security]].

[fn:149] The ~org-babel-no-eval-on-ctrl-c-ctrl-c~ variable can be used
to remove code evaluation from the {{{kbd(C-c C-c)}}} key binding.

[fn:150] Note that evaluation of header arguments is guaranteed to
take place in the original Org mode file, while there is no such
guarantee for evaluation of the code block body.

[fn:151] The example requires that property inheritance be turned on
for the ~noweb-ref~ property, see [[Property inheritance]].

[fn:152] In certain languages this also contains the error output
stream; this is an area for future work.

[fn:153] The last evaluation performed by the interpreter is obtained
in a language-specific manner: the value of the variable ~_~ in Python
and Ruby, and the value of ~.Last.value~ in R.

[fn:161] If the {{{samp(#+TBLFM)}}} line contains an odd number of
dollar characters, this may cause problems with font-lock in LaTeX
mode.  As shown in the example you can fix this by adding an extra line
inside the ~comment~ environment that is used to balance the dollar
expressions.  If you are using AUCTeX with the font-latex library, a
much better solution is to add the ~comment~ environment to the
variable ~LaTeX-verbatim-environments~.

[fn:162] The HTML translator uses the same code that produces tables
during HTML export.

[fn:154] Note that ~org-indent-mode~ also sets the ~wrap-prefix~
property, such that ~visual-line-mode~ (or purely setting ~word-wrap~)
wraps long lines (including headlines) correctly indented.

[fn:155] See the variable ~org-indent-indentation-per-level~.

[fn:156] Turning on ~org-indent-mode~ sets ~org-hide-leading-stars~ to
~t~ and ~org-adapt-indentation~ to ~nil~.

[fn:157] See also the variable ~org-adapt-indentation~.

[fn:158] When you need to specify a level for a property search or
refile targets, ~LEVEL=2~ will correspond to 3 stars, etc.

[fn:159] The {{{file(org-R.el)}}} package has been replaced by the
Org mode functionality described in [[Working with source code]] and is
now obsolete.

[fn:160] By default this works only for LaTeX, HTML, and Texinfo.
Configure the variable ~orgtbl-radio-tables~ to install templates for
other modes.

[fn:163] Note that, when using ~org-odd-levels-only~, a level number
corresponds to order in the hierarchy, not to the number of stars.

[fn:164] If you can safely store the password in your Emacs setup, you
might also want to configure `org-mobile-encryption-password'.  Please
read the docstring of that variable.  Note that encryption will apply
only to the contents of the `.org' files.  The file names themselves
will remain visible.

[fn:165] If you cannot use Dropbox, or if your version of MobileOrg
does not support it, you can use a webdav server.  For more
information, check out the documentation of MobileOrg and also this
[[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#mobileorg_webdav][FAQ entry]].

[fn:166] While creating the agendas, Org mode will force ID properties
on all referenced entries, so that these entries can be uniquely
identified if /MobileOrg/ flags them for further action.  If you do not
want to get these properties in so many entries, you can set the
variable ~org-mobile-force-id-on-agenda-items~ to ~nil~.  Org mode will
then rely on outline paths, in the hope that these will be unique
enough.

[fn:167] Checksums are stored automatically in the file
{{{file(checksums.dat)}}}.

[fn:168] The file {{{file(mobileorg.org)}}} will be empty after this
operation.

[fn:169] Note, however, that there is a subtle difference.  The view
created automatically by {{{kbdspckey(M-x org-mobile-pull,RET)}}} is
guaranteed to search all files that have been addressed by the last
pull.  This might include a file that is not currently in your list of
agenda files.  If you later use {{{kbd(C-c a ?)}}} to regenerate the
view, only the current agenda files will be searched.

[fn:170] You can also get `a.', `A.', `a)' and `A)' by configuring
`org-alphabetical-lists'.  To minimize confusion with normal text,
those are limited to one character only.  Beyond that limit, bullets
will automatically fallback to numbers.

[fn:171] See also ~org-empty-line-terminates-plain-lists~.

[fn:172] You can define additional drawers on a per-file basis with a
line like ~#+DRAWERS: HIDDEN STATE~.

[fn:173] The corresponding in-buffer setting is: ~#+STARTUP: fninline~ or
~#+STARTUP: nofninline~.

[fn:174] The corresponding in-buffer options are ~#+STARTUP: fnadjust~ and
~#+STARTUP: nofnadjust~.

[fn:175] The file {{{file(constants.el)}}} can supply the values of constants in two
different unit systems, ~SI~ and ~cgs~.  Which one is used depends on
the value of the variable ~constants-unit-system~.  You can use the
~#+STARTUP:~ options ~constSI~ and ~constcgs~ to set this value for the
current buffer.

[fn:176] The library {{{file(org-id)}}} must first be loaded, either through
~org-customize~ by enabling ~id~ in ~org-modules~, or by adding
~(require 'org-id)~ in your {{{file(.emacs)}}}.

[fn:177] The variable ~org-startup-with-inline-images~ can be set
within a buffer with the ~#+STARTUP:~ keywords ~inlineimages~ and
~noinlineimages~.

[fn:178] Note that the ~LOGBOOK~ drawer is unfolded when pressing
{{{key(SPC)}}} in the agenda to show an entry---use
{{{kbdspckey(C-u,SPC)}}} to keep it folded here.

[fn:179] Please note the pitfalls of summing hierarchical data in a flat
list ([[Agenda column view]]).

[fn:180] If the value of that variable is not a list, but a single file
name, then the list of agenda files will be maintained in that external
file.

[fn:181] The variable ~org-anniversary~ used in the example
is just like ~diary-anniversary~, but the argument order is
always according to ISO and therefore independent of the value of
~calendar-date-style~.

[fn:182] Emacs 23 and Org mode 6.29 are required.

[fn:183] Emacs 23.1 can actually crash with ~org-indent-mode~.

[fn:184] Symbolic links in ~org-directory~ need to have the same name
as their targets.
