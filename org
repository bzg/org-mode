1.1 Summary
===========

Org-mode is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and doing
project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.

   Org-mode develops organizational tasks around NOTES files that
contain lists or information about projects as plain text.  Org-mode is
implemented on top of outline-mode, which makes it possible to keep the
content of large files well structured.  Visibility cycling and
structure editing help to work with the tree.  Tables are easily created
with a built-in table editor.  Org-mode supports TODO items, deadlines,
time stamps, and scheduling.  It dynamically compiles entries into an
agenda that utilizes and smoothly integrates much of the Emacs calendar
and diary.  Plain text URL-like links connect to websites, emails,
Usenet messages, BBDB entries, and any files related to the projects.
For printing and sharing of notes, an Org-mode file can be exported as a
structured ASCII file, as HTML, or (todo and agenda items only) as an
iCalendar file.  It can also serve as a publishing tool for a set of
linked webpages.

   An important design aspect that distinguishes Org-mode from for
example Planner/Muse is that it encourages to store every piece of
information only once.  In Planner, you have project pages, day pages
and possibly other files, duplicating some information such as tasks.
In Org-mode, you only have notes files.  In your notes you mark entries
as tasks, label them with tags and timestamps.  All necessary lists
like a schedule for the day, the agenda for a meeting, tasks lists
selected by tags etc are created dynamically when you need them.

   Org-mode keeps simple things simple.  When first fired up, it should
feel like a straightforward, easy to use outliner.  Complexity is not
imposed, but a large amount of functionality is available when you need
it.  Org-mode is a toolbox and can be used in different ways, for
example as:

     * outline extension with visibility cycling and structure editing
     * ASCII system and table editor for taking structured notes
     * ASCII table editor with spreadsheet-like capabilities
     * TODO list editor
     * full agenda and planner with deadlines and work scheduling
     * environment to implement David Allen's GTD system
     * a basic database application
     * simple hypertext system, with HTML and LaTeX export
     * publishing tool to create a set of interlinked webpages

   Org-mode's automatic, context sensitive table editor with spreadsheet
capabilities can be integrated into any major mode by activating the
minor Orgtbl-mode.  Using a translation step, it can be used to maintain
tables in arbitrary file types, for example in LaTeX.  The structure
editing and list creation capabilities can be used outside Org-mode with
the minor Orgstruct-mode.

   There is a website for Org-mode which provides links to the newest
version of Org-mode, as well as additional information, frequently asked
questions (FAQ), links to tutorials etc.  This page is located at
`http://orgmode.org'.


File: org,  Node: Installation,  Next: Activation,  Prev: Summary,  Up: Introduction

1.2 Installation
================

Important: If Org-mode is part of the Emacs distribution or an XEmacs
package, please skip this section and go directly to *Note Activation::.

   If you have downloaded Org-mode from the Web, you must take the
following steps to install it: Go into the Org-mode distribution
directory and edit the top section of the file `Makefile'.  You must
set the name of the Emacs binary (likely either `emacs' or `xemacs'),
and the paths to the directories where local Lisp and Info files are
kept.  If you don't have access to the system-wide directories, create
your own two directories for these files, enter them into the Makefile,
and make sure Emacs finds the Lisp files by adding the following line
to `.emacs':

     (setq load-path (cons "~/path/to/lispdir" load-path))

   XEmacs users now need to install the file `noutline.el' from the
`xemacs' subdirectory of the Org-mode distribution.  Use the command:

     make install-noutline

Now byte-compile and install the Lisp files with the shell commands:

     make
     make install

If you want to install the info documentation, use this command:

     make install-info

Then add to `.emacs':

     ;; This line only if org-mode is not part of the X/Emacs distribution.
     (require 'org-install)


File: org,  Node: Activation,  Next: Feedback,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Introduction

1.3 Activation
==============

Add the following lines to your `.emacs' file.  The last two lines
define _global_ keys for the commands `org-store-link' and `org-agenda'
- please choose suitable keys yourself.

     ;; The following lines are always needed.  Choose your own keys.
     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.org\\'" . org-mode))
     (global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)
     (global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)

   Furthermore, you must activate `font-lock-mode' in org-mode buffers,
because significant functionality depends on font-locking being active.
You can do this with either one of the following two lines (XEmacs
user must use the second option):
     (global-font-lock-mode 1)                     ; for all buffers
     (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)  ; org-mode buffers only

   With this setup, all files with extension `.org' will be put into
Org-mode.  As an alternative, make the first line of a file look like
this:

     MY PROJECTS    -*- mode: org; -*-

which will select Org-mode for this buffer no matter what the file's
name is.  See also the variable `org-insert-mode-line-in-empty-file'.

1.4 Feedback
============

If you find problems with Org-mode, or if you have questions, remarks,
or ideas about it, please contact the maintainer Carsten Dominik at
<carsten at orgmode dot org>.

   For bug reports, please provide as much information as possible,
including the version information of Emacs (`C-h v emacs-version
<RET>') and Org-mode (`C-h v org-version <RET>'), as well as the
Org-mode related setup in `.emacs'.  If an error occurs, a backtrace
can be very useful (see below on how to create one).  Often a small
example file helps, along with clear information about:

  1. What exactly did you do?

  2. What did you expect to happen?

  3. What happened instead?
        Thank you for helping to improve this mode.

How to create a useful backtrace
................................

If working with Org-mode produces an error with a message you don't
understand, you may have hit a bug.  The best way to report this is by
providing, in addition to what was mentioned above, a _Backtrace_.
This is information from the built-in debugger about where and how the
error occurred.  Here is how to produce a useful backtrace:

  1. Start a fresh Emacs or XEmacs, and make sure that it will load the
     original Lisp code in `org.el' instead of the compiled version in
     `org.elc'.  The backtrace contains much more information if it is
     produced with uncompiled code.  To do this, either rename `org.elc'
     to something else before starting Emacs, or ask Emacs explicitly
     to load `org.el' by using the command line
          emacs -l /path/to/org.el

  2. Go to the `Options' menu and select `Enter Debugger on Error'
     (XEmacs has this option in the `Troubleshooting' sub-menu).

  3. Do whatever you have to do to hit the error.  Don't forget to
     document the steps you take.

  4. When you hit the error, a `*Backtrace*' buffer will appear on the
     screen.  Save this buffer to a file (for example using `C-x C-w')
     and attach it to your bug report.

1.5 Typesetting conventions used in this manual
===============================================

Org-mode has 3 types of keywords that are being used.  TODO keywords,
tags, and property names.  For this manual we are using the following
conventions:

`TODO'
`WAITING'
     TODO keyword are written with all capitals, even if they are
     user-defined.

`boss'
`ARCHIVE'
     User-defined Tags are written in lowercase, built-in tags with
     special meaning a all-caps.

`Release'
`PRIORITY'
     User-defined properties are capitalized in all examples, while
     built-in properties with special meaning are all-caps.

File: org,  Node: Outlines,  Next: Headlines,  Prev: Document structure,  Up: Document structure

2.1 Outlines
============

Org-mode is implemented on top of outline-mode.  Outlines allow a
document to be organized in a hierarchical structure, which (at least
for me) is the best representation of notes and thoughts.  An overview
of this structure is achieved by folding (hiding) large parts of the
document to show only the general document structure and the parts
currently being worked on.  Org-mode greatly simplifies the use of
outlines by compressing the entire show/hide functionality into a single
command `org-cycle', which is bound to the <TAB> key.


File: org,  Node: Headlines,  Next: Visibility cycling,  Prev: Outlines,  Up: Document structure

2.2 Headlines
=============

Headlines define the structure of an outline tree.  The headlines in
Org-mode start with one or more stars, on the left margin(1).  For
example:

     * Top level headline
     ** Second level
     *** 3rd level
         some text
     *** 3rd level
         more text

     * Another top level headline

Some people find the many stars too noisy and would prefer an outline
that has whitespace followed by a single star as headline starters.
*Note Clean view:: describes a setup to realize this.

   An empty line after the end of a subtree is considered part of it and
will be hidden when the subtree is folded.  However, if you leave at
least two empty lines, one empty line will remain visible after folding
the subtree, in order to structure the collapsed view.  See the
variable `org-cycle-separator-lines' to modify this behavior.

behavior of `C-a' and `C-e' in headlines.


File: org,  Node: Visibility cycling,  Next: Motion,  Prev: Headlines,  Up: Document structure

2.3 Visibility cycling
======================

Outlines make it possible to hide parts of the text in the buffer.
Org-mode uses just two commands, bound to <TAB> and `S-<TAB>' to change
the visibility in the buffer.

`<TAB>'
     _Subtree cycling_: Rotate current subtree among the states

          ,-> FOLDED -> CHILDREN -> SUBTREE --.
          '-----------------------------------'

     The cursor must be on a headline for this to work(1).  When the
     cursor is at the beginning of the buffer and the first line is not
     a headline, then <TAB> actually runs global cycling (see
     below)(2).  Also when called with a prefix argument (`C-u <TAB>'),
     global cycling is invoked.

`S-<TAB>'
`C-u <TAB>'
     _Global cycling_: Rotate the entire buffer among the states

          ,-> OVERVIEW -> CONTENTS -> SHOW ALL --.
          '--------------------------------------'

     When `S-<TAB>' is called with a numerical prefix N, the CONTENTS
     view up to headlines of level N will be shown.  Note that inside
     tables, `S-<TAB>' jumps to the previous field.

`C-c C-a'
     Show all.  

`C-c C-r'
     Reveal context around point, showing the current entry, the
     following heading and the hierarchy above.  Useful for working
     near a location exposed by a sparse tree command (*note Sparse
     trees::) or an agenda command (*note Agenda commands::).  With
     prefix arg show, on each level, all sibling headings.  

`C-c C-x b'
     Show the current subtree in an indirect buffer(3).  With numerical
     prefix ARG, go up to this level and then take that tree.  If ARG is
     negative, go up that many levels.  With `C-u' prefix, do not remove
     the previously used indirect buffer.

   When Emacs first visits an Org-mode file, the global state is set to
OVERVIEW, i.e. only the top level headlines are visible.  This can be
configured through the variable `org-startup-folded', or on a per-file
basis by adding one of the following lines anywhere in the buffer:

     #+STARTUP: overview
     #+STARTUP: content
     #+STARTUP: showall

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) see, however, the option `org-cycle-emulate-tab'.

   (2) see the option `org-cycle-global-at-bob'.

   (3) The indirect buffer (*note Indirect Buffers: (emacs)Indirect
Buffers.)  will contain the entire buffer, but will be narrowed to the
current tree.  Editing the indirect buffer will also change the
original buffer, but without affecting visibility in that buffer.


File: org,  Node: Motion,  Next: Structure editing,  Prev: Visibility cycling,  Up: Document structure

2.4 Motion
==========

The following commands jump to other headlines in the buffer.

`C-c C-n'
     Next heading.  

`C-c C-p'
     Previous heading.  

`C-c C-f'
     Next heading same level.  

`C-c C-b'
     Previous heading same level.  

`C-c C-u'
     Backward to higher level heading.  

`C-c C-j'
     Jump to a different place without changing the current outline
     visibility.  Shows the document structure in a temporary buffer,
     where you can use the following keys to find your destination:
          <TAB>         Cycle visibility.
          <down> / <up>   Next/previous visible headline.
          n / p        Next/previous visible headline.
          f / b        Next/previous headline same level.
          u            One level up.
          0-9          Digit argument.
          <RET>         Select this location.


File: org,  Node: Structure editing,  Next: Archiving,  Prev: Motion,  Up: Document structure

2.5 Structure editing
=====================

`M-<RET>'
     Insert new heading with same level as current.  If the cursor is
     in a plain list item, a new item is created (*note Plain lists::).
     To force creation of a new headline, use a prefix arg, or first
     press <RET> to get to the beginning of the next line.  When this
     command is used in the middle of a line, the line is split and the
     rest of the line becomes the new headline.  If the command is used
     at the beginning of a headline, the new headline is created before
     the current line.  If at the beginning of any other line, the
     content of that line is made the new heading.  If the command is
     used at the end of a folded subtree (i.e. behind the ellipses at
     the end of a headline), then a headline like the current one will
     be inserted after the end of the subtree.  

`C-<RET>'
     Insert a new heading after the current subtree, same level as the
     current headline.  This command works from anywhere in the entry.  

`M-S-<RET>'
     Insert new TODO entry with same level as current heading.  

`M-<left>'
     Promote current heading by one level.  

`M-<right>'
     Demote current heading by one level.  

`M-S-<left>'
     Promote the current subtree by one level.  

`M-S-<right>'
     Demote the current subtree by one level.  

`M-S-<up>'
     Move subtree up (swap with previous subtree of same level).  

`M-S-<down>'
     Move subtree down (swap with next subtree of same level).  

`C-c C-x C-w'
`C-c C-x C-k'
     Kill subtree, i.e. remove it from buffer but save in kill ring.
     With prefix arg, kill N sequential subtrees.  

`C-c C-x M-w'
     Copy subtree to kill ring.  With prefix arg, copy N sequential
     subtrees.  

`C-c C-x C-y'
     Yank subtree from kill ring.  This does modify the level of the
     subtree to make sure the tree fits in nicely at the yank position.
     The yank level can also be specified with a prefix arg, or by
     yanking after a headline marker like `****'.  

`C-c C-w'
     Refile entry to a different location.  *Note Refiling notes::.  

`C-c ^'
     Sort same-level entries.  When there is an active region, all
     entries in the region will be sorted.  Otherwise the children of
     the current headline are sorted.  The command prompts for the
     sorting method, which can be alphabetically, numerically, by time
     (using the first time stamp in each entry), by priority, and each
     of these in reverse order.  You can also supply your own function
     to extract the sorting key.  With a `C-u' prefix, sorting will be
     case-sensitive.  With two `C-u C-u' prefixes, duplicate entries
     will also be removed.

   When there is an active region (transient-mark-mode), promotion and
demotion work on all headlines in the region.  To select a region of
headlines, it is best to place both point and mark at the beginning of a
line, mark at the beginning of the first headline, and point at the line
just after the last headline to change.  Note that when the cursor is
inside a table (*note Tables::), the Meta-Cursor keys have different
functionality.

2.6 Archiving
=============

When a project represented by a (sub)tree is finished, you may want to
move the tree out of the way and to stop it from contributing to the
agenda.  Org-mode knows two ways of archiving.  You can mark a tree with
the ARCHIVE tag, or you can move an entire (sub)tree to a different
location.

* Menu:

* ARCHIVE tag::                 Marking a tree as inactive
* Moving subtrees::             Moving a tree to an archive file


File: org,  Node: ARCHIVE tag,  Next: Moving subtrees,  Prev: Archiving,  Up: Archiving

2.6.1 The ARCHIVE tag
---------------------

A headline that is marked with the ARCHIVE tag (*note Tags::) stays at
its location in the outline tree, but behaves in the following way:
   - It does not open when you attempt to do so with a visibility
     cycling command (*note Visibility cycling::).  You can force
     cycling archived subtrees with `C-<TAB>', or by setting the option
     `org-cycle-open-archived-trees'.  Also normal outline commands like
     `show-all' will open archived subtrees.

   - During sparse tree construction (*note Sparse trees::), matches in
     archived subtrees are not exposed, unless you configure the option
     `org-sparse-tree-open-archived-trees'.

   - During agenda view construction (*note Agenda views::), the
     content of archived trees is ignored unless you configure the
     option `org-agenda-skip-archived-trees'.

   - Archived trees are not exported (*note Exporting::), only the
     headline is.  Configure the details using the variable
     `org-export-with-archived-trees'.

   The following commands help managing the ARCHIVE tag:

`C-c C-x C-a'
     Toggle the ARCHIVE tag for the current headline.  When the tag is
     set, the headline changes to a shadowish face, and the subtree
     below it is hidden.  

`C-u C-c C-x C-a'
     Check if any direct children of the current headline should be
     archived.  To do this, each subtree is checked for open TODO
     entries.  If none are found, the command offers to set the ARCHIVE
     tag for the child.  If the cursor is _not_ on a headline when this
     command is invoked, the level 1 trees will be checked.  

`C-TAB'
     Cycle a tree even if it is tagged with ARCHIVE.


File: org,  Node: Moving subtrees,  Prev: ARCHIVE tag,  Up: Archiving

2.6.2 Moving subtrees
---------------------

Once an entire project is finished, you may want to move it to a
different location, either in the current file, or even in a different
file, the archive file.

`C-c C-x C-s'
     Archive the subtree starting at the cursor position to the location
     given by `org-archive-location'.  Context information that could be
     lost like the file name, the category, inherited tags, and the todo
     state will be store as properties in the entry.  

`C-u C-c C-x C-s'
     Check if any direct children of the current headline could be
     moved to the archive.  To do this, each subtree is checked for
     open TODO entries.  If none are found, the command offers to move
     it to the archive location.  If the cursor is _not_ on a headline
     when this command is invoked, the level 1 trees will be checked.

   The default archive location is a file in the same directory as the
current file, with the name derived by appending `_archive' to the
current file name.  For information and examples on how to change this,
see the documentation string of the variable `org-archive-location'.
There is also an in-buffer option for setting this variable, for
example(1):

     #+ARCHIVE: %s_done::

If you would like to have a special ARCHIVE location for a single entry
or a (sub)tree, give the entry an `:ARCHIVE:' property with the
location as the value (*note Properties and columns::).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For backward compatibility, the following also works: If there
are several such lines in a file, each specifies the archive location
for the text below it.  The first such line also applies to any text
before its definition.  However, using this method is _strongly_
deprecated as it is incompatible with the outline structure of the
document.  The correct method for setting multiple archive locations in
a buffer is using a property.


File: org,  Node: Sparse trees,  Next: Plain lists,  Prev: Archiving,  Up: Document structure

2.7 Sparse trees
================

An important feature of Org-mode is the ability to construct _sparse
trees_ for selected information in an outline tree.  A sparse tree
means that the entire document is folded as much as possible, but the
selected information is made visible along with the headline structure
above it(1).  Just try it out and you will see immediately how it works.

   Org-mode contains several commands creating such trees, all these
commands can be accessed through a dispatcher:

`C-c /'
     This prompts for an extra key to select a sparse-tree creating
     command.  

`C-c / r'
     Occur.  Prompts for a regexp and shows a sparse tree with all
     matches.  If the match is in a headline, the headline is made
     visible.  If the match is in the body of an entry, headline and
     body are made visible.  In order to provide minimal context, also
     the full hierarchy of headlines above the match is shown, as well
     as the headline following the match.  Each match is also
     highlighted; the highlights disappear when the buffer is changed
     by an editing command, or by pressing `C-c C-c'.  When called with
     a `C-u' prefix argument, previous highlights are kept, so several
     calls to this command can be stacked.
   For frequently used sparse trees of specific search strings, you can
use the variable `org-agenda-custom-commands' to define fast keyboard
access to specific sparse trees.  These commands will then be
accessible through the agenda dispatcher (*note Agenda dispatcher::).
For example:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("f" occur-tree "FIXME")))

will define the key `C-c a f' as a shortcut for creating a sparse tree
matching the string `FIXME'.

   The other sparse tree commands select headings based on TODO
keywords, tags, or properties and will be discussed later in this
manual.

   To print a sparse tree, you can use the Emacs command
`ps-print-buffer-with-faces' which does not print invisible parts of
the document (2).  Or you can use the command `C-c C-e v' to export
only the visible part of the document and print the resulting file.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See also the variables `org-show-hierarchy-above',
`org-show-following-heading', and `org-show-siblings' for detailed
control on how much context is shown around each match.

   (2) This does not work under XEmacs, because XEmacs uses selective
display for outlining, not text properties.


File: org,  Node: Plain lists,  Next: Drawers,  Prev: Sparse trees,  Up: Document structure

2.8 Plain lists
===============

Within an entry of the outline tree, hand-formatted lists can provide
additional structure.  They also provide a way to create lists of
checkboxes (*note Checkboxes::).  Org-mode supports editing such lists,
and the HTML exporter (*note Exporting::) does parse and format them.

   Org-mode knows ordered and unordered lists.  Unordered list items
start with `-', `+', or `*'(1) as bullets.  Ordered list items start
with `1.' or `1)'.  Items belonging to the same list must have the same
indentation on the first line.  In particular, if an ordered list
reaches number `10.', then the 2-digit numbers must be written
left-aligned with the other numbers in the list.  Indentation also
determines the end of a list item.  It ends before the next line that
is indented like the bullet/number, or less.  Empty lines are part of
the previous item, so you can have several paragraphs in one item.  If
you would like an empty line to terminate all currently open plain
lists, configure the variable `org-empty-line-terminates-plain-lists'.
Here is an example:

     ** Lord of the Rings
        My favorite scenes are (in this order)
        1. The attack of the Rohirrim
        2. Eowyns fight with the witch king
           + this was already my favorite scene in the book
           + I really like Miranda Otto.
        3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
            - on DVD only
           He makes a really funny face when it happens.
        But in the end, not individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.

   Org-mode supports these lists by tuning filling and wrapping
commands to deal with them correctly(2).

   The following commands act on items when the cursor is in the first
line of an item (the line with the bullet or number).

`<TAB>'
     Items can be folded just like headline levels if you set the
     variable `org-cycle-include-plain-lists'.  The level of an item is
     then given by the indentation of the bullet/number.  Items are
     always subordinate to real headlines, however; the hierarchies
     remain completely separated.

     If `org-cycle-include-plain-lists' has not been set, <TAB> fixes
     the indentation of the curent line in a heuristic way.  

`M-<RET>'
     Insert new item at current level.  With prefix arg, force a new
     heading (*note Structure editing::).  If this command is used in
     the middle of a line, the line is _split_ and the rest of the line
     becomes the new item.  If this command is executed in the
     _whitespace before a bullet or number_, the new item is created
     _before_ the current item.  If the command is executed in the
     white space before the text that is part of an item but does not
     contain the bullet, a bullet is added to the current line.  

`M-S-<RET>'
     Insert a new item with a checkbox (*note Checkboxes::).  

`S-<up>'
`S-<down>'
     Jump to the previous/next item in the current list.  

`M-S-<up>'
`M-S-<down>'
     Move the item including subitems up/down (swap with previous/next
     item of same indentation).  If the list is ordered, renumbering is
     automatic.  

`M-S-<left>'
`M-S-<right>'
     Decrease/increase the indentation of the item, including subitems.
     Initially, the item tree is selected based on current indentation.
     When these commands are executed several times in direct
     succession, the initially selected region is used, even if the new
     indentation would imply a different hierarchy.  To use the new
     hierarchy, break the command chain with a cursor motion or so.  

`C-c C-c'
     If there is a checkbox (*note Checkboxes::) in the item line,
     toggle the state of the checkbox.  If not, make this command makes
     sure that all the items on this list level use the same bullet.
     Furthermore, if this is an ordered list, make sure the numbering
     is ok.  

`C-c -'
     Cycle the entire list level through the different itemize/enumerate
     bullets (`-', `+', `*', `1.', `1)').  With prefix arg, select the
     nth bullet from this list.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) When using `*' as a bullet, lines must be indented or they will
be seen as top-level headlines.  Also, when you are hiding leading
stars to get a clean outline view, plain list items starting with a
star are visually indistinguishable from true headlines.  In short:
even though `*' is supported, it may be better not to use it for plain
list items.

   (2) Org-mode only changes the filling settings for Emacs.  For
XEmacs, you should use Kyle E. Jones' `filladapt.el'.  To turn this on,
put into `.emacs': `(require 'filladapt)'


File: org,  Node: Drawers,  Next: orgstruct-mode,  Prev: Plain lists,  Up: Document structure

2.9 Drawers
===========

Sometimes you want to keep information associated with an entry, but you
normally don't want to see it.  For this, Org-mode has _drawers_.
Drawers need to be configured with the variable `org-drawers'(1), and
look like this:

     ** This is a headline
        Still outside the drawer
        :DRAWERNAME:
           This is inside the drawer.
        :END:
        After the drawer.

   Visibility cycling (*note Visibility cycling::) on the headline will
hide and show the entry, but keep the drawer collapsed to a single line.
In order to look inside the drawer, you need to move the cursor to the
drawer line and press <TAB> there.  Org-mode uses a drawer for storing
properties (*note Properties and columns::).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You can define drawers on a per-file basis with a line like
`#+DRAWERS: HIDDEN PROPPERTIES STATE'


File: org,  Node: orgstruct-mode,  Prev: Drawers,  Up: Document structure

2.10 The Orgstruct minor mode
=============================

If you like the intuitive way the Org-mode structure editing and list
formatting works, you might want to use these commands in other modes
like text-mode or mail-mode as well.  The minor mode Orgstruct-mode
makes this possible.  You can always toggle the mode with `M-x
orgstruct-mode'.  To turn it on by default, for example in mail mode,
use

     (add-hook 'mail-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgstruct)

   When this mode is active and the cursor is on a line that looks to
Org-mode like a headline of the first line of a list item, most
structure editing commands will work, even if the same keys normally
have different functionality in the major mode you are using.  If the
cursor is not in one of those special lines, Orgstruct-mode lurks
silently in the shadow.

3 Tables

File: org,  Node: Built-in table editor,  Next: Narrow columns,  Prev: Tables,  Up: Tables

3.1 The built-in table editor
=============================

Org-mode makes it easy to format tables in plain ASCII.  Any line with
`|' as the first non-whitespace character is considered part of a
table.  `|' is also the column separator.  A table might look like this:

     | Name  | Phone | Age |
     |-------+-------+-----|
     | Peter |  1234 |  17 |
     | Anna  |  4321 |  25 |

   A table is re-aligned automatically each time you press <TAB> or
<RET> or `C-c C-c' inside the table.  <TAB> also moves to the next
field (<RET> to the next row) and creates new table rows at the end of
the table or before horizontal lines.  The indentation of the table is
set by the first line.  Any line starting with `|-' is considered as a
horizontal separator line and will be expanded on the next re-align to
span the whole table width.  So, to create the above table, you would
only type

     |Name|Phone|Age|
     |-

and then press <TAB> to align the table and start filling in fields.

   When typing text into a field, Org-mode treats <DEL>, <Backspace>,
and all character keys in a special way, so that inserting and deleting
avoids shifting other fields.  Also, when typing _immediately after the
cursor was moved into a new field with `<TAB>', `S-<TAB>' or `<RET>'_,
the field is automatically made blank.  If this behavior is too
unpredictable for you, configure the variables
`org-enable-table-editor' and `org-table-auto-blank-field'.

Creation and conversion
.......................

`C-c |'
     Convert the active region to table. If every line contains at
     least one TAB character, the function assumes that the material is
     tab separated.  If every line contains a comma, comma-separated
     values (CSV) are assumed.  If not, lines are split at whitespace
     into fields.  You can use a prefix argument to force a specific
     separator: `C-u' forces CSV, `C-u C-u' forces TAB, and a numeric
     argument N indicates that at least N consequtive spaces, or
     alternatively a TAB will be the separator.
     If there is no active region, this command creates an empty
     Org-mode table.  But it's easier just to start typing, like
     `|Name|Phone|Age <RET> |- <TAB>'.

Re-aligning and field motion
............................

`C-c C-c'
     Re-align the table without moving the cursor.  

`<TAB>'
     Re-align the table, move to the next field.  Creates a new row if
     necessary.  

`S-<TAB>'
     Re-align, move to previous field.  

`<RET>'
     Re-align the table and move down to next row.  Creates a new row if
     necessary.  At the beginning or end of a line, <RET> still does
     NEWLINE, so it can be used to split a table.

Column and row editing
......................

`M-<left>'
`M-<right>'
     Move the current column left/right.  

`M-S-<left>'
     Kill the current column.  

`M-S-<right>'
     Insert a new column to the left of the cursor position.  

`M-<up>'
`M-<down>'
     Move the current row up/down.  

`M-S-<up>'
     Kill the current row or horizontal line.  

`M-S-<down>'
     Insert a new row above (with arg: below) the current row.  

`C-c -'
     Insert a horizontal line below current row. With prefix arg, the
     line is created above the current line.  

`C-c ^'
     Sort the table lines in the region.  The position of point
     indicates the column to be used for sorting, and the range of
     lines is the range between the nearest horizontal separator lines,
     or the entire table.  If point is before the first column, you
     will be prompted for the sorting column.  If there is an active
     region, the mark specifies the first line and the sorting column,
     while point should be in the last line to be included into the
     sorting.  The command prompts for the sorting type
     (alphabetically, numerically, or by time).  When called with a
     prefix argument, alphabetic sorting will be case-sensitive.

Regions
.......

`C-c C-x M-w'
     Copy a rectangular region from a table to a special clipboard.
     Point and mark determine edge fields of the rectangle.  The
     process ignores horizontal separator lines.  

`C-c C-x C-w'
     Copy a rectangular region from a table to a special clipboard, and
     blank all fields in the rectangle.  So this is the "cut" operation.  

`C-c C-x C-y'
     Paste a rectangular region into a table.  The upper right corner
     ends up in the current field.  All involved fields will be
     overwritten.  If the rectangle does not fit into the present table,
     the table is enlarged as needed.  The process ignores horizontal
     separator lines.  

`C-c C-q'
     Wrap several fields in a column like a paragraph.  If there is an
     active region, and both point and mark are in the same column, the
     text in the column is wrapped to minimum width for the given
     number of lines.  A prefix ARG may be used to change the number of
     desired lines.  If there is no region, the current field is split
     at the cursor position and the text fragment to the right of the
     cursor is prepended to the field one line down. If there is no
     region, but you specify a prefix ARG, the current field is made
     blank, and the content is appended to the field above.

Calculations
............

`C-c +'
     Sum the numbers in the current column, or in the rectangle defined
     by the active region.  The result is shown in the echo area and can
     be inserted with `C-y'.  

`S-<RET>'
     When current field is empty, copy from first non-empty field above.
     When not empty, copy current field down to next row and move cursor
     along with it.  Depending on the variable
     `org-table-copy-increment', integer field values will be
     incremented during copy.  This key is also used by CUA-mode (*note
     Cooperation::).

Miscellaneous
.............

`C-c `'
     Edit the current field in a separate window.  This is useful for
     fields that are not fully visible (*note Narrow columns::).  When
     called with a `C-u' prefix, just make the full field visible, so
     that it can be edited in place.  

`C-c <TAB>'
     This is an alias for `C-u C-c `' to make the current field fully
     visible.

`M-x org-table-import'
     Import a file as a table.  The table should be TAB- or whitespace
     separated.  Useful, for example, to import a spreadsheet table or
     data from a database, because these programs generally can write
     TAB-separated text files.  This command works by inserting the
     file into the buffer and then converting the region to a table.
     Any prefix argument is passed on to the converter, which uses it
     to determine the separator.

`C-c |'
     Tables can also be imported by pasting tabular text into the
     org-mode buffer, selecting the pasted text with `C-x C-x' and then
     using the `C-c |' command (see above under Creation and conversion.

`M-x org-table-export'
     Export the table as a TAB-separated file.  Useful for data
     exchange with, for example, spreadsheet or database programs.

   If you don't like the automatic table editor because it gets in your
way on lines which you would like to start with `|', you can turn it
off with

     (setq org-enable-table-editor nil)

Then the only table command that still works is `C-c C-c' to do a
manual re-align.

3.2 Narrow columns
==================

The width of columns is automatically determined by the table editor.
Sometimes a single field or a few fields need to carry more text,
leading to inconveniently wide columns.  To limit(1) the width of a
column, one field anywhere in the column may contain just the string
`<N>' where `N' is an integer specifying the width of the column in
characters.  The next re-align will then set the width of this column
to no more than this value.

     |---+------------------------------|               |---+--------|
     |   |                              |               |   | <6>    |
     | 1 | one                          |               | 1 | one    |
     | 2 | two                          |     ----\     | 2 | two    |
     | 3 | This is a long chunk of text |     ----/     | 3 | This=> |
     | 4 | four                         |               | 4 | four   |
     |---+------------------------------|               |---+--------|

Fields that are wider become clipped and end in the string `=>'.  Note
that the full text is still in the buffer, it is only invisible.  To
see the full text, hold the mouse over the field - a tool-tip window
will show the full content.  To edit such a field, use the command `C-c
`' (that is `C-c' followed by the backquote).  This will open a new
window with the full field.  Edit it and finish with `C-c C-c'.

   When visiting a file containing a table with narrowed columns, the
necessary character hiding has not yet happened, and the table needs to
be aligned before it looks nice.  Setting the option
`org-startup-align-all-tables' will realign all tables in a file upon
visiting, but also slow down startup.  You can also set this option on
a per-file basis with:

     #+STARTUP: align
     #+STARTUP: noalign

3.3 Column groups
=================

When Org-mode exports tables, it does so by default without vertical
lines because that is visually more satisfying in general.  Occasionally
however, vertical lines can be useful to structure a table into groups
of columns, much like horizontal lines can do for groups of rows.  In
order to specify column groups, you can use a special row where the
first field contains only `/'.  The further fields can either contain
`<' to indicate that this column should start a group, `>' to indicate
the end of a column, or `<>' to make a column a group of its own.
Boundaries between colum groups will upon export be marked with
vertical lines.  Here is an example:

     |   |  N | N^2 | N^3 | N^4 | sqrt(n) | sqrt[4](N) |
     |---+----+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
     | / | <> |   < |     |   > |       < |          > |
     | # |  1 |   1 |   1 |   1 |       1 |          1 |
     | # |  2 |   4 |   8 |  16 |  1.4142 |     1.1892 |
     | # |  3 |   9 |  27 |  81 |  1.7321 |     1.3161 |
     |---+----+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
     #+TBLFM: $3=$2^2::$4=$2^3::$5=$2^4::$6=sqrt($2)::$7=sqrt(sqrt(($2))

   It is also sufficient to just insert the colum group starters after
every vertical line you'd like to have:

     |  N | N^2 | N^3 | N^4 | sqrt(n) | sqrt[4](N) |
     |----+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
     | /  | <   |     |     | <       |            |

3.4 The Orgtbl minor mode
=========================

If you like the intuitive way the Org-mode table editor works, you
might also want to use it in other modes like text-mode or mail-mode.
The minor mode Orgtbl-mode makes this possible.  You can always toggle
the mode with `M-x orgtbl-mode'.  To turn it on by default, for example
in mail mode, use

     (add-hook 'mail-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgtbl)

   Furthermore, with some special setup, it is possible to maintain
tables in arbitrary syntax with Orgtbl-mode.  For example, it is
possible to construct LaTeX tables with the underlying ease and power of
Orgtbl-mode, including spreadsheet capabilities.  For details, see
*Note Tables in arbitrary syntax::.


File: org,  Node: The spreadsheet,  Prev: orgtbl-mode,  Up: Tables

3.5 The spreadsheet
===================

The table editor makes use of the Emacs `calc' package to implement
spreadsheet-like capabilities.  It can also evaluate Emacs Lisp forms to
derive fields from other fields.  While fully featured, Org-mode's
implementation is not identical to other spreadsheets.  For example,
Org-mode knows the concept of a _column formula_ that will be applied
to all non-header fields in a column without having to copy the formula
to each relevant field.

3.5.1 References
----------------

To compute fields in the table from other fields, formulas must
reference other fields or ranges.  In Org-mode, fields can be referenced
by name, by absolute coordinates, and by relative coordinates.  To find
out what the coordinates of a field are, press `C-c ?' in that field,
or press `C-c }' to toggle the display of a grid.

Field references
................

Formulas can reference the value of another field in two ways.  Like in
any other spreadsheet, you may reference fields with a letter/number
combination like `B3', meaning the 2nd field in the 3rd row.

Org-mode also uses another, more general operator that looks like this:
     @row$column

Column references can be absolute like `1', `2',...`N', or relative to
the current column like `+1' or `-2'.

   The row specification only counts data lines and ignores horizontal
separator lines (hlines).  You can use absolute row numbers `1'...`N',
and row numbers relative to the current row like `+3' or `-1'.  Or
specify the row relative to one of the hlines: `I' refers to the first
hline(1), `II' to the second etc.  `-I' refers to the first such line
above the current line, `+I' to the first such line below the current
line.  You can also write `III+2' which is the second data line after
the third hline in the table.  Relative row numbers like `-3' will not
cross hlines if the current line is too close to the hline.  Instead,
the value directly at the hline is used.

   `0' refers to the current row and column.  Also, if you omit either
the column or the row part of the reference, the current row/column is
implied.

   Org-mode's references with _unsigned_ numbers are fixed references
in the sense that if you use the same reference in the formula for two
different fields, the same field will be referenced each time.
Org-mode's references with _signed_ numbers are floating references
because the same reference operator can reference different fields
depending on the field being calculated by the formula.

   Here are a few examples:

     @2$3      2nd row, 3rd column
     C2        same as previous
     $5        column 5 in the current row
     E&        same as previous
     @2        current column, row 2
     @-1$-3    the field one row up, three columns to the left
     @-I$2     field just under hline above current row, column 2

Range references
................

You may reference a rectangular range of fields by specifying two field
references connected by two dots `..'.  If both fields are in the
current row, you may simply use `$2..$7', but if at least one field is
in a different row, you need to use the general `@row$column' format at
least for the first field (i.e the reference must start with `@' in
order to be interpreted correctly).  Examples:

     $1..$3        First three fields in the current row.
     $P..$Q        Range, using column names (see under Advanced)
     @2$1..@4$3    6 fields between these two fields.
     A2..C4        Same as above.
     @-1$-2..@-1   3 numbers from the column to the left, 2 up to current row

Range references return a vector of values that can be fed into Calc
vector functions.  Empty fields in ranges are normally suppressed, so
that the vector contains only the non-empty fields (but see the `E'
mode switch below).  If there are no non-empty fields, `[0]' is
returned to avoid syntax errors in formulas.

Named references
................

`$name' is interpreted as the name of a column, parameter or constant.
Constants are defined globally through the variable
`org-table-formula-constants', and locally (for the file) through a
line like

     #+CONSTANTS: c=299792458. pi=3.14 eps=2.4e-6

Also properties (*note Properties and columns::) can be used as
constants in table formulas: For a property `:XYZ:' use the name
`$PROP_XYZ', and the property will be searched in the current outline
entry and in the hierarchy above it.  If you have the `constants.el'
package, it will also be used to resolve constants, including natural
constants like `$h' for Planck's constant, and units like `$km' for
kilometers(2).  Column names and parameters can be specified in special
table lines.  These are described below, see *Note Advanced features::.
All names must start with a letter, and further consist of letters and
numbers.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that only hlines are counted that _separate_ table lines.
If the table starts with a hline above the header, it does not count.

   (2) `Constant.el' can supply the values of constants in two
different unit systems, `SI' and `cgs'.  Which one is used depends on
the value of the variable `constants-unit-system'.  You can use the
`#+STARTUP' options `constSI' and `constcgs' to set this value for the
current buffer.

3.5.2 Formula syntax for Calc
-----------------------------

A formula can be any algebraic expression understood by the Emacs
`Calc' package.  Note that `calc' has the non-standard convention that
`/' has lower precedence than `*', so that `a/b*c' is interpreted as
`a/(b*c)'.  Before evaluation by `calc-eval' (*note calc-eval:
(calc)Calling Calc from Your Programs.), variable substitution takes
place according to the rules described above.  The range vectors can be
directly fed into the calc vector functions like `vmean' and `vsum'.

   A formula can contain an optional mode string after a semicolon.
This string consists of flags to influence Calc and other modes during
execution.  By default, Org-mode uses the standard calc modes (precision
12, angular units degrees, fraction and symbolic modes off.  The display
format, however, has been changed to `(float 5)' to keep tables
compact.  The default settings can be configured using the variable
`org-calc-default-modes'.

     p20           switch the internal precision to 20 digits
     n3 s3 e2 f4   normal, scientific, engineering, or fixed display format
     D R           angle modes: degrees, radians
     F S           fraction and symbolic modes
     N             interpret all fields as numbers, use 0 for non-numbers
     T             force text interpretation
     E             keep empty fields in ranges

In addition, you may provide a `printf' format specifier to reformat
the final result.  A few examples:

     $1+$2                Sum of first and second field
     $1+$2;%.2f           Same, format result to two decimals
     exp($2)+exp($1)      Math functions can be used
     $0;%.1f              Reformat current cell to 1 decimal
     ($3-32)*5/9          Degrees F -> C conversion
     $c/$1/$cm            Hz -> cm conversion, using `constants.el'
     tan($1);Dp3s1        Compute in degrees, precision 3, display SCI 1
     sin($1);Dp3%.1e      Same, but use printf specifier for display
     vmean($2..$7)        Compute column range mean, using vector function
     vmean($2..$7);EN     Same, but treat empty fields as 0
     taylor($3,x=7,2)     taylor series of $3, at x=7, second degree

   Calc also contains a complete set of logical operations.  For example

     if($1<20,teen,string(""))  "teen" if age $1 less than 20, else empty


File: org,  Node: Formula syntax for Lisp,  Next: Field formulas,  Prev: Formula syntax for Calc,  Up: The spreadsheet

3.5.3 Emacs Lisp forms as formulas
----------------------------------

It is also possible to write a formula in Emacs Lisp; this can be useful
for string manipulation and control structures, if the Calc's
functionality is not enough.  If a formula starts with a single quote
followed by an opening parenthesis, then it is evaluated as a lisp form.
The evaluation should return either a string or a number.  Just as with
`calc' formulas, you can specify modes and a printf format after a
semicolon.  With Emacs Lisp forms, you need to be concious about the way
field references are interpolated into the form.  By default, a
reference will be interpolated as a Lisp string (in double quotes)
containing the field.  If you provide the `N' mode switch, all
referenced elements will be numbers (non-number fields will be zero) and
interpolated as Lisp numbers, without quotes.  If you provide the `L'
flag, all fields will be interpolated literally, without quotes.  I.e.,
if you want a reference to be interpreted as a string by the Lisp form,
enclode the reference operator itself in double quotes, like `"$3"'.
Ranges are inserted as space-separated fields, so you can embed them in
list or vector syntax.  A few examples, note how the `N' mode is used
when we do computations in lisp.

     Swap the first two characters of the content of column 1
       '(concat (substring $1 1 2) (substring $1 0 1) (substring $1 2))
     Add columns 1 and 2, equivalent to the Calc's `$1+$2'
       '(+ $1 $2);N
     Compute the sum of columns 1-4, like Calc's `vsum($1..$4)'
       '(apply '+ '($1..$4));N


File: org,  Node: Field formulas,  Next: Column formulas,  Prev: Formula syntax for Lisp,  Up: The spreadsheet

3.5.4 Field formulas
--------------------

To assign a formula to a particular field, type it directly into the
field, preceded by `:=', for example `:=$1+$2'.  When you press <TAB>
or <RET> or `C-c C-c' with the cursor still in the field, the formula
will be stored as the formula for this field, evaluated, and the
current field replaced with the result.

   Formulas are stored in a special line starting with `#+TBLFM:'
directly below the table.  If you typed the equation in the 4th field of
the 3rd data line in the table, the formula will look like
`@3$4=$1+$2'.  When inserting/deleting/swapping column and rows with
the appropriate commands, absolute references (but not relative ones)
in stored formulas are modified in order to still reference the same
field.  Of cause this is not true if you edit the table structure with
normal editing commands - then you must fix the equations yourself.

   Instead of typing an equation into the field, you may also use the
following command

`C-u C-c ='
     Install a new formula for the current field.  The command prompts
     for a formula, with default taken from the `#+TBLFM:' line, applies
     it to the current field and stores it.


File: org,  Node: Column formulas,  Next: Editing and debugging formulas,  Prev: Field formulas,  Up: The spreadsheet

3.5.5 Column formulas
---------------------

Often in a table, the same formula should be used for all fields in a
particular column.  Instead of having to copy the formula to all fields
in that column, org-mode allows to assign a single formula to an entire
column.  If the table contains horizontal separator hlines, everything
before the first such line is considered part of the table _header_ and
will not be modified by column formulas.

   To assign a formula to a column, type it directly into any field in
the column, preceded by an equal sign, like `=$1+$2'.  When you press
<TAB> or <RET> or `C-c C-c' with the cursor still in the field, the
formula will be stored as the formula for the current column, evaluated
and the current field replaced with the result.  If the field contains
only `=', the previously stored formula for this column is used.  For
each column, Org-mode will only remember the most recently used
formula.  In the `TBLFM:' line, column formulas will look like
`$4=$1+$2'.

   Instead of typing an equation into the field, you may also use the
following command:

`C-c ='
     Install a new formula for the current column and replace current
     field with the result of the formula.  The command prompts for a
     formula, with default taken from the `#+TBLFM' line, applies it to
     the current field and stores it.  With a numerical prefix (e.g.
     `C-5 C-c =') will apply it to that many consecutive fields in the
     current column.


File: org,  Node: Editing and debugging formulas,  Next: Updating the table,  Prev: Column formulas,  Up: The spreadsheet

3.5.6 Editing and Debugging formulas
------------------------------------

You can edit individual formulas in the minibuffer or directly in the
field.  Org-mode can also prepare a special buffer with all active
formulas of a table.  When offering a formula for editing, Org-mode
converts references to the standard format (like `B3' or `D&') if
possible.  If you prefer to only work with the internal format (like
`@3$2' or `$4'), configure the variable
`org-table-use-standard-references'.

`C-c ='
`C-u C-c ='
     Edit the formula associated with the current column/field in the
     minibuffer.  See *Note Column formulas:: and *Note Field
     formulas::.  

`C-u C-u C-c ='
     Re-insert the active formula (either a field formula, or a column
     formula) into the current field, so that you can edit it directly
     in the field.  The advantage over editing in the minibuffer is
     that you can use the command `C-c ?'.  

`C-c ?'
     While editing a formula in a table field, highlight the field(s)
     referenced by the reference at the cursor position in the formula.  

`C-c }'
     Toggle the display of row and column numbers for a table, using
     overlays.  These are updated each time the table is aligned, you
     can force it with `C-c C-c'.  

`C-c {'
     Toggle the formula debugger on and off.  See below.  

`C-c ''
     Edit all formulas for the current table in a special buffer, where
     the formulas will be displayed one per line.  If the current field
     has an active formula, the cursor in the formula editor will mark
     it.  While inside the special buffer, Org-mode will automatically
     highlight any field or range reference at the cursor position.
     You may edit, remove and add formulas, and use the following
     commands:
    `C-c C-c'
    `C-x C-s'
          Exit the formula editor and store the modified formulas.
          With `C-u' prefix, also apply the new formulas to the entire
          table.  

    `C-c C-q'
          Exit the formula editor without installing changes.  

    `C-c C-r'
          Toggle all references in the formula editor between standard
          (like `B3') and internal (like `@3$2').  

    `<TAB>'
          Pretty-print or indent lisp formula at point.  When in a line
          containing a lisp formula, format the formula according to
          Emacs Lisp rules.  Another <TAB> collapses the formula back
          again.  In the open formula, <TAB> re-indents just like in
          Emacs-lisp-mode.  

    `M-<TAB>'
          Complete Lisp symbols, just like in Emacs-lisp-mode.  

    `S-<up>/<down>/<left>/<right>'
          Shift the reference at point.  For example, if the reference
          is `B3' and you press `S-<right>', it will become `C3'.  This
          also works for relative references, and for hline references.  

    `M-S-<up>/<down>'
          Move the test line for column formulas in the Org-mode buffer
          up and down.  

    `M-<up>/<down>'
          Scroll the window displaying the table.  

    `C-c }'
          Turn the coordinate grid in the table on and off.

   Making a table field blank does not remove the formula associated
with the field, because that is stored in a different line (the `TBLFM'
line) - during the next recalculation the field will be filled again.
To remove a formula from a field, you have to give an empty reply when
prompted for the formula, or to edit the `#+TBLFM' line.

   You may edit the `#+TBLFM' directly and re-apply the changed
equations with `C-c C-c' in that line, or with the normal recalculation
commands in the table.

Debugging formulas
..................

When the evaluation of a formula leads to an error, the field content
becomes the string `#ERROR'.  If you would like see what is going on
during variable substitution and calculation in order to find a bug,
turn on formula debugging in the `Tbl' menu and repeat the calculation,
for example by pressing `C-u C-u C-c = <RET>' in a field.  Detailed

3.5.7 Updating the Table
------------------------

Recalculation of a table is normally not automatic, but needs to be
triggered by a command.  See *Note Advanced features:: for a way to make
recalculation at least semi-automatically.

   In order to recalculate a line of a table or the entire table, use
the following commands:

`C-c *'
     Recalculate the current row by first applying the stored column
     formulas from left to right, and all field formulas in the current
     row.  

`C-u C-c *'
`C-u C-c C-c'
     Recompute the entire table, line by line.  Any lines before the
     first hline are left alone, assuming that these are part of the
     table header.  

`C-u C-u C-c *'
`C-u C-u C-c C-c'
     Iterate the table by recomputing it until no further changes occur.
     This may be necessary if some computed fields use the value of
     other fields that are computed later in the calculation sequence.

3.5.8 Advanced features
-----------------------

If you want the recalculation of fields to happen automatically, or if
you want to be able to assign names to fields and columns, you need to
reserve the first column of the table for special marking characters.
`C-#'
     Rotate the calculation mark in first column through the states `',
     `#', `*', `!', `$'.  The meaning of these characters is discussed
     below.  When there is an active region, change all marks in the
     region.

   Here is an example of a table that collects exam results of students
and makes use of these features:

     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     |   | Student | Prob 1 | Prob 2 | Prob 3 | Total | Note |
     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     | ! |         |     P1 |     P2 |     P3 |   Tot |      |
     | # | Maximum |     10 |     15 |     25 |    50 | 10.0 |
     | ^ |         |     m1 |     m2 |     m3 |    mt |      |
     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     | # | Peter   |     10 |      8 |     23 |    41 |  8.2 |
     | # | Sara    |      6 |     14 |     19 |    39 |  7.8 |
     | # | Sam     |      2 |      4 |      3 |     9 |  1.8 |
     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     |   | Average |        |        |        |  29.7 |      |
     | ^ |         |        |        |        |    at |      |
     | $ | max=50  |        |        |        |       |      |
     |---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
     #+TBLFM: $6=vsum($P1..$P3)::$7=10*$Tot/$max;%.1f::$at=vmean(@-II..@-I);%.1f

Important: Please note that for these special tables, recalculating the
table with `C-u C-c *' will only affect rows that are marked `#' or
`*', and fields that have a formula assigned to the field itself.  The
column formulas are not applied in rows with empty first field.

   The marking characters have the following meaning:
`!'
     The fields in this line define names for the columns, so that you
     may refer to a column as `$Tot' instead of `$6'.

`^'
     This row defines names for the fields _above_ the row.  With such
     a definition, any formula in the table may use `$m1' to refer to
     the value `10'.  Also, if you assign a formula to a names field, it
     will be stored as `$name=...'.

`_'
     Similar to `^', but defines names for the fields in the row
     _below_.

`$'
     Fields in this row can define _parameters_ for formulas.  For
     example, if a field in a `$' row contains `max=50', then formulas
     in this table can refer to the value 50 using `$max'.  Parameters
     work exactly like constants, only that they can be defined on a
     per-table basis.

`#'
     Fields in this row are automatically recalculated when pressing
     <TAB> or <RET> or `S-<TAB>' in this row.  Also, this row is
     selected for a global recalculation with `C-u C-c *'.  Unmarked
     lines will be left alone by this command.

`*'
     Selects this line for global recalculation with `C-u C-c *', but
     not for automatic recalculation.  Use this when automatic
     recalculation slows down editing too much.

`'
     Unmarked lines are exempt from recalculation with `C-u C-c *'.
     All lines that should be recalculated should be marked with `#' or
     `*'.

`/'
     Do not export this line.  Useful for lines that contain the
     narrowing `<N>' markers.

   Finally, just to whet your appetite on what can be done with the
fantastic `calc' package, here is a table that computes the Taylor
series of degree `n' at location `x' for a couple of functions
(homework: try that with Excel :-)

     |---+-------------+---+-----+--------------------------------------|
     |   | Func        | n | x   | Result                               |

File: org,  Node: Link format,  Next: Internal links,  Prev: Hyperlinks,  Up: Hyperlinks

4.1 Link format
===============

Org-mode will recognize plain URL-like links and activate them as
clickable links.  The general link format, however, looks like this:

     [[link][description]]       or alternatively           [[link]]

   Once a link in the buffer is complete (all brackets present),
Org-mode will change the display so that `description' is displayed
instead of `[[link][description]]' and `link' is displayed instead of
`[[link]]'.  Links will be highlighted in the face `org-link', which by
default is an underlined face.  You can directly edit the visible part
of a link.  Note that this can be either the `link' part (if there is
no description) or the `description' part.  To edit also the invisible
`link' part, use `C-c C-l' with the cursor on the link.

   If you place the cursor at the beginning or just behind the end of
the displayed text and press <BACKSPACE>, you will remove the
(invisible) bracket at that location.  This makes the link incomplete
and the internals are again displayed as plain text.  Inserting the
missing bracket hides the link internals again.  To show the internal
structure of all links, use the menu entry `Org->Hyperlinks->Literal
links'.


File: org,  Node: Internal links,  Next: External links,  Prev: Link format,  Up: Hyperlinks

4.2 Internal links
==================

If the link does not look like a URL, it is considered to be internal in
the current file.  Links such as `[[My Target]]' or `[[My Target][Find
my target]]' lead to a text search in the current file.  The link can
be followed with `C-c C-o' when the cursor is on the link, or with a
mouse click (*note Handling links::).  The preferred match for such a
link is a dedicated target: the same string in double angular brackets.
Targets may be located anywhere; sometimes it is convenient to put
them into a comment line. For example

     # <<My Target>>

In HTML export (*note HTML export::), such targets will become named
anchors for direct access through `http' links(1).

   If no dedicated target exists, Org-mode will search for the words in
the link.  In the above example the search would be for `my target'.
Links starting with a star like `*My Target' restrict the search to
headlines.  When searching, Org-mode will first try an exact match, but
then move on to more and more lenient searches.  For example, the link
`[[*My Targets]]' will find any of the following:

     ** My targets
     ** TODO my targets are bright
     ** my 20 targets are

   To insert a link targeting a headline, in-buffer completion can be
used.  Just type a star followed by a few optional letters into the
buffer and press `M-<TAB>'.  All headlines in the current buffer will be
offered as completions.  *Note Handling links::, for more commands
creating links.

   Following a link pushes a mark onto Org-mode's own mark ring.  You
can return to the previous position with `C-c &'.  Using this command
several times in direct succession goes back to positions recorded
earlier.

* Menu:

* Radio targets::               Make targets trigger links in plain text.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that text before the first headline is usually not
exported, so the first such target should be after the first headline.


File: org,  Node: Radio targets,  Prev: Internal links,  Up: Internal links

4.2.1 Radio targets
-------------------

Org-mode can automatically turn any occurrences of certain target names
in normal text into a link.  So without explicitly creating a link, the
text connects to the target radioing its position.  Radio targets are
enclosed by triple angular brackets.  For example, a target `<<<My
Target>>>' causes each occurrence of `my target' in normal text to
become activated as a link.  The Org-mode file is scanned automatically
for radio targets only when the file is first loaded into Emacs.  To
update the target list during editing, press `C-c C-c' with the cursor
on or at a target.

4.3 External links
==================

Org-mode supports links to files, websites, Usenet and email messages,
and BBDB database entries.  External links are URL-like locators.  They
start with a short identifying string followed by a colon.  There can be
no space after the colon.  The following list shows examples for each
link type.

   A link should be enclosed in double brackets and may contain a
descriptive text to be displayed instead of the url (*note Link
format::), for example:

     [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]]

If the description is a file name or URL that points to an image, HTML
export (*note HTML export::) will inline the image as a clickable
button.  If there is no description at all and the link points to an
image, that image will be inlined into the exported HTML file.

   Org-mode also finds external links in the normal text and activates
them as links.  If spaces must be part of the link (for example in
`bbdb:Richard Stallman'), or if you need to remove ambiguities about
the end of the link, enclose them in angular brackets.


File: org,  Node: Handling links,  Next: Using links outside Org-mode,  Prev: External links,  Up: Hyperlinks

4.4 Handling links
==================

Org-mode provides methods to create a link in the correct syntax, to
insert it into an org-mode file, and to follow the link.

`C-c l'
     Store a link to the current location.  This is a _global_ command
     which can be used in any buffer to create a link.  The link will be
     stored for later insertion into an Org-mode buffer (see below).
     For Org-mode files, if there is a `<<target>>' at the cursor, the
     link points to the target.  Otherwise it points to the current
     headline.  For VM, RMAIL, WANDERLUST, MH-E, GNUS and BBDB buffers,
     the link will indicate the current article/entry.  For W3 and W3M
     buffers, the link goes to the current URL.  For any other files,
     the link will point to the file, with a search string (*note
     Search options::) pointing to the contents of the current line.
     If there is an active region, the selected words will form the
     basis of the search string.  If the automatically created link is
     not working correctly or accurately enough, you can write custom
     functions to select the search string and to do the search for
     particular file types - see *Note Custom searches::.  The key
     binding `C-c l' is only a suggestion - see *Note Installation::.  

`C-c C-l'
     Insert a link.  This prompts for a link to be inserted into the
     buffer.  You can just type a link, using text for an internal
     link, or one of the link type prefixes mentioned in the examples
     above.  All links stored during the current session are part of
     the history for this prompt, so you can access them with <up> and
     <down> (or `M-p/n').  Completion, on the other hand, will help you
     to insert valid link prefixes like `http:' or `ftp:', including
     the prefixes defined through link abbreviations (*note Link
     abbreviations::).  The link will be inserted into the buffer(1),
     along with a descriptive text.  If some text was selected when
     this command is called, the selected text becomes the default
     description.
     Note that you don't have to use this command to insert a link.
     Links in Org-mode are plain text, and you can type or paste them
     straight into the buffer.  By using this command, the links are
     automatically enclosed in double brackets, and you will be asked
     for the optional descriptive text.  

`C-u C-c C-l'
     When `C-c C-l' is called with a `C-u' prefix argument, a link to a
     file will be inserted and you may use file name completion to
     select the name of the file.  The path to the file is inserted
     relative to the directory of the current org file, if the linked
     file is in the current directory or in a subdirectory of it, or if
     the path is written relative to the current directory using `../'.
     Otherwise an absolute path is used, if possible with `~/' for
     your home directory.  You can force an absolute path with two
     `C-u' prefixes.

`C-c C-l (with cursor on existing link)'
     When the cursor is on an existing link, `C-c C-l' allows you to
     edit the link and description parts of the link.  

`C-c C-o'
     Open link at point.  This will launch a web browser for URLs (using
     `browse-url-at-point'), run vm/mh-e/wanderlust/rmail/gnus/bbdb for
     the corresponding links, and execute the command in a shell link.
     When the cursor is on an internal link, this commands runs the
     corresponding search.  When the cursor is on a TAG list in a
     headline, it creates the corresponding TAGS view.  If the cursor
     is on a time stamp, it compiles the agenda for that date.
     Furthermore, it will visit text and remote files in `file:' links
     with Emacs and select a suitable application for local non-text
     files.  Classification of files is based on file extension only.
     See option `org-file-apps'.  If you want to override the default
     application and visit the file with Emacs, use a `C-u' prefix.  

`mouse-2'
`mouse-1'
     On links, `mouse-2' will open the link just as `C-c C-o' would.
     Under Emacs 22, also `mouse-1' will follow a link.  

`mouse-3'
     Like `mouse-2', but force file links to be opened with Emacs, and
     internal links to be displayed in another window(2).  

`C-c %'
     Push the current position onto the mark ring, to be able to return
     easily. Commands following an internal link do this automatically.  

`C-c &'
     Jump back to a recorded position.  A position is recorded by the
     commands following internal links, and by `C-c %'.  Using this
     command several times in direct succession moves through a ring of
     previously recorded positions.  

`C-c C-x C-n'
`C-c C-x C-p'
     Move forward/backward to the next link in the buffer.  At the
     limit of the buffer, the search fails once, and then wraps around.
     The key bindings for this are really too long, you might want to
     bind this also to `C-n' and `C-p'
          (add-hook 'org-load-hook
            (lambda ()
              (define-key 'org-mode-map "\C-n" 'org-next-link)
              (define-key 'org-mode-map "\C-p" 'org-previous-link)))

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) After insertion of a stored link, the link will be removed from
the list of stored links.  To keep it in the list later use, use a
triple `C-u' prefix to `C-c C-l', or configure the option
`org-keep-stored-link-after-insertion'.

   (2) See the variable `org-display-internal-link-with-indirect-buffer'

4.5 Using links outside Org-mode
================================

You can insert and follow links that have Org-mode syntax not only in
Org-mode, but in any Emacs buffer.  For this, you should create two
global commands, like this (please select suitable global keys
yourself):

     (global-set-key "\C-c L" 'org-insert-link-global)
     (global-set-key "\C-c o" 'org-open-at-point-global)


File: org,  Node: Link abbreviations,  Next: Search options,  Prev: Using links outside Org-mode,  Up: Hyperlinks

4.6 Link abbreviations
======================

Long URLs can be cumbersome to type, and often many similar links are
needed in a document.  For this you can use link abbreviations.  An
abbreviated link looks like this

     [[linkword:tag][description]]

where the tag is optional.  Such abbreviations are resolved according to
the information in the variable `org-link-abbrev-alist' that relates
the linkwords to replacement text.  Here is an example:

     (setq org-link-abbrev-alist
       '(("bugzilla" . "http://10.1.2.9/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=")
         ("google"   . "http://www.google.com/search?q=")
         ("ads"      . "http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/
                        nph-abs_connect?author=%s&db_key=AST")))

   If the replacement text contains the string `%s', it will be
replaced with the tag.  Otherwise the tag will be appended to the string
in order to create the link.  You may also specify a function that will
be called with the tag as the only argument to create the link.

   With the above setting, you could link to a specific bug with
`[[bugzilla:129]]', search the web for `OrgMode' with
`[[google:OrgMode]]' and find out what the Org-mode author is doing
besides Emacs hacking with `[[ads:Dominik,C]]'.

   If you need special abbreviations just for a single Org-mode buffer,
you can define them in the file with

     #+LINK: bugzilla  http://10.1.2.9/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=
     #+LINK: google    http://www.google.com/search?q=%s

In-buffer completion *note Completion:: can be used after `[' to
complete link abbreviations.


File: org,  Node: Search options,  Next: Custom searches,  Prev: Link abbreviations,  Up: Hyperlinks

4.7 Search options in file links
================================

File links can contain additional information to make Emacs jump to a
particular location in the file when following a link.  This can be a
line number or a search option after a double(1) colon. For example,
when the command `C-c l' creates a link (*note Handling links::) to a
file, it encodes the words in the current line as a search string that
can be used to find this line back later when following the link with
`C-c C-o'.

   Here is the syntax of the different ways to attach a search to a file
link, together with an explanation:

     [[file:~/code/main.c::255]]
     [[file:~/xx.org::My Target]]
     [[file:~/xx.org::*My Target]]
     [[file:~/xx.org::/regexp/]]

`255'
     Jump to line 255.

`My Target'
     Search for a link target `<<My Target>>', or do a text search for
     `my target', similar to the search in internal links, see *Note
     Internal links::.  In HTML export (*note HTML export::), such a
     file link will become an HTML reference to the corresponding named
     anchor in the linked file.

`*My Target'
     In an Org-mode file, restrict search to headlines.

`/regexp/'
     Do a regular expression search for `regexp'.  This uses the Emacs
     command `occur' to list all matches in a separate window.  If the
     target file is in Org-mode, `org-occur' is used to create a sparse
     tree with the matches.

   As a degenerate case, a file link with an empty file name can be used
to search the current file.  For example, `[[file:::find me]]' does a
search for `find me' in the current file, just as `[[find me]]' would.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For backward compatibility, line numbers can also follow a
single colon.


File: org,  Node: Custom searches,  Prev: Search options,  Up: Hyperlinks

4.8 Custom Searches
===================

The default mechanism for creating search strings and for doing the
actual search related to a file link may not work correctly in all
cases.  For example, BibTeX database files have many entries like
`year="1993"' which would not result in good search strings, because
the only unique identification for a BibTeX entry is the citation key.

   If you come across such a problem, you can write custom functions to
set the right search string for a particular file type, and to do the
search for the string in the file.  Using `add-hook', these functions
need to be added to the hook variables
`org-create-file-search-functions' and
`org-execute-file-search-functions'.  See the docstring for these
variables for more information.  Org-mode actually uses this mechanism
for BibTeX database files, and you can use the corresponding code as an
implementation example.  Search for `BibTeX links' in the source file.

5 TODO items
************

Org-mode does not maintain TODO lists as a separate document.  TODO
items are an integral part of the notes file, because TODO items
usually come up while taking notes!  With Org-mode, you simply mark any
entry in a tree as being a TODO item.  In this way, the information is
not duplicated, and the entire context from which the item emerged is
always present when you check.

   Of course, this technique causes TODO items to be scattered
throughout your file.  Org-mode provides methods to give you an
overview over all things you have to do.

5.1 Basic TODO functionality
============================

Any headline can become a TODO item by starting it with the word TODO,
for example:

     *** TODO Write letter to Sam Fortune

The most important commands to work with TODO entries are:

`C-c C-t'
     Rotate the TODO state of the current item among

          ,-> (unmarked) -> TODO -> DONE --.
          '--------------------------------'

     The same rotation can also be done "remotely" from the timeline and
     agenda buffers with the `t' command key (*note Agenda commands::).

`C-u C-c C-t'
     Select a specific keyword using completion of (if it has been set
     up) the fast selection interface.

`S-<right>'
`S-<left>'
     Select the following/preceding TODO state, similar to cycling.
     Mostly useful if more than two TODO states are possible (*note
     TODO extensions::).  

`C-c C-c'
     Use the fast tag interface to quickly and directly select a
     specific TODO state.  For this you need to assign keys to TODO
     state, like this:
          #+SEQ_TODO: TODO(t) STARTED(s) WAITING(w) | DONE(d)
     See *Note Per file keywords:: and *Note Setting tags:: for more
     information.  

`C-c C-v'
`C-c / t'
     View TODO items in a _sparse tree_ (*note Sparse trees::).  Folds
     the entire buffer, but shows all TODO items and the headings
     hierarchy above them.  With prefix arg, search for a specific
     TODO.  You will be prompted for the keyword, and you can also give
     a list of keywords like `kwd1|kwd2|...'.  With numerical prefix N,
     show the tree for the Nth keyword in the variable
     `org-todo-keywords'.  With two prefix args, find all TODO and DONE
     entries.  

`C-c a t'
     Show the global TODO list.  This collects the TODO items from all
     agenda files (*note Agenda views::) into a single buffer.  The
     buffer is in `agenda-mode', so there are commands to examine and
     manipulate the TODO entries directly from that buffer (*note
     Agenda commands::).  *Note Global TODO list::, for more
     information.  

`S-M-<RET>'
     Insert a new TODO entry below the current one.

5.2 Extended use of TODO keywords
=================================

The default implementation of TODO entries is just two states: TODO and
DONE.  You can use the TODO feature for more complicated things by
configuring the variable `org-todo-keywords'.  With special setup, the
TODO keyword system can work differently in different files.

   Note that tags are another way to classify headlines in general and
TODO items in particular (*note Tags::).

* Menu:

* Workflow states::             From TODO to DONE in steps
* TODO types::                  I do this, Fred the rest
* Multiple sets in one file::   Mixing it all, and still finding your way
* Fast access to TODO states::  Single letter selection of a state
* Per file keywords::           Different files, different requirements
* Faces for TODO keywords::     Highlighting states


File: org,  Node: Workflow states,  Next: TODO types,  Prev: TODO extensions,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.1 TODO keywords as workflow states
--------------------------------------

You can use TODO keywords to indicate different _sequential_ states in
the process of working on an item, for example(1):

     (setq org-todo-keywords
       '((sequence "TODO" "FEEDBACK" "VERIFY" "|" "DONE" "DELEGATED")))

   The vertical bar separates the TODO keywords (states that _need
action_) from the DONE states (which need _no further action_.  If you
don't provide the separator bar, the last state is used as the DONE
state.  With this setup, the command `C-c C-t' will cycle an entry from
TODO to FEEDBACK, then to VERIFY, and finally to DONE and DELEGATED.
You may also use a prefix argument to quickly select a specific state.
For example `C-3 C-c C-t' will change the state immediately to VERIFY.
If you define many keywords, you can use in-buffer completion (see
*Note Completion::) to insert these words into the buffer.  Changing a
todo state can be logged with a timestamp, see *Note Tracking TODO
state changes:: for more information.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Changing this variable only becomes effective after restarting
Org-mode in a buffer.


File: org,  Node: TODO types,  Next: Multiple sets in one file,  Prev: Workflow states,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.2 TODO keywords as types
----------------------------

The second possibility is to use TODO keywords to indicate different
_types_ of action items.  For example, you might want to indicate that
items are for "work" or "home".  Or, when you work with several people
on a single project, you might want to assign action items directly to
persons, by using their names as TODO keywords.  This would be set up
like this:

     (setq org-todo-keywords '((type "Fred" "Sara" "Lucy" "|" "DONE")))

   In this case, different keywords do not indicate a sequence, but
rather different types.  So the normal work flow would be to assign a
task to a person, and later to mark it DONE.  Org-mode supports this
style by adapting the workings of the command `C-c C-t'(1).  When used
several times in succession, it will still cycle through all names, in
order to first select the right type for a task.  But when you return
to the item after some time and execute `C-c C-t' again, it will switch
from any name directly to DONE.  Use prefix arguments or completion to
quickly select a specific name.  You can also review the items of a
specific TODO type in a sparse tree by using a numeric prefix to `C-c
C-v'.  For example, to see all things Lucy has to do, you would use
`C-3 C-c C-v'.  To collect Lucy's items from all agenda files into a
single buffer, you would use the prefix arg as well when creating the
global todo list: `C-3 C-c t'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This is also true for the `t' command in the timeline and agenda
buffers.


File: org,  Node: Multiple sets in one file,  Next: Fast access to TODO states,  Prev: TODO types,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.3 Multiple keyword sets in one file
---------------------------------------

Sometimes you may want to use different sets of TODO keywords in
parallel.  For example, you may want to have the basic `TODO'/`DONE',
but also a workflow for bug fixing, and a separate state indicating
that an item has been canceled (so it is not DONE, but also does not
require action).  Your setup would then look like this:

     (setq org-todo-keywords
           '((sequence "TODO" "|" "DONE")
             (sequence "REPORT" "BUG" "KNOWNCAUSE" "|" "FIXED")
             (sequence "|" "CANCELED")))

   The keywords should all be different, this helps Org-mode to keep
track of which subsequence should be used for a given entry.  In this
setup, `C-c C-t' only operates within a subsequence, so it switches from
`DONE' to (nothing) to `TODO', and from `FIXED' to (nothing) to
`REPORT'.  Therefore you need a mechanism to initially select the
correct sequence.  Besides the obvious ways like typing a keyword or
using completion, you may also apply the following commands:

`C-S-<right>'
`C-S-<left>'
     These keys jump from one TODO subset to the next.  In the above
     example, `C-S-<right>' would jump from `TODO' or `DONE' to
     `REPORT', and any of the words in the second row to `CANCELED'.  

`S-<right>'
`S-<left>'
     `S-<<left>>' and `S-<<right>>' and walk through _all_ keywords
     from all sets, so for example `S-<<right>>' would switch from
     `DONE' to `REPORT' in the example above.

5.2.4 Fast access to TODO states
--------------------------------

If you would like to quickly change an entry to an arbitrary TODO state
instead of cycling through the states, you can set up keys for
single-letter access to the states.  This is done by adding the section
key after each keyword, in parenthesis.  For example:

     (setq org-todo-keywords
           '((sequence "TODO(t)" "|" "DONE(d)")
             (sequence "REPORT(r)" "BUG(b)" "KNOWNCAUSE(k)" "|" "FIXED(f)")
             (sequence "|" "CANCELED(c)")))

   If you then press `C-u C-c C-t' followed by the selection key, the
entry will be switched to this state.  <SPC> can be used to remove any
TODO keyword from an entry.  Should you like this way of selecting TODO
states a lot, you might want to set the variable
`org-use-fast-todo-selection' to `t' and make this behavior the
default.  Check also the variable
`org-fast-tag-selection-include-todo', it allows to change the TODO
state through the tags interface (*note Setting tags::).


File: org,  Node: Per file keywords,  Next: Faces for TODO keywords,  Prev: Fast access to TODO states,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.5 Setting up keywords for individual files
----------------------------------------------

It can be very useful to use different aspects of the TODO mechanism in
different files.  For file-local settings, you need to add special lines
to the file which set the keywords and interpretation for that file
only.  For example, to set one of the two examples discussed above, you
need one of the following lines, starting in column zero anywhere in the
file:

     #+SEQ_TODO: TODO FEEDBACK VERIFY | DONE CANCELED
   or
     #+TYP_TODO: Fred Sara Lucy Mike | DONE

   A setup for using several sets in parallel would be:

     #+SEQ_TODO: TODO | DONE
     #+SEQ_TODO: REPORT BUG KNOWNCAUSE | FIXED
     #+SEQ_TODO: | CANCELED

To make sure you are using the correct keyword, type `#+' into the
buffer and then use `M-<TAB>' completion.

   Remember that the keywords after the vertical bar (or the last
keyword if no bar is there) must always mean that the item is DONE
(although you may use a different word).  After changing one of these
lines, use `C-c C-c' with the cursor still in the line to make the
changes known to Org-mode(1).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Org-mode parses these lines only when Org-mode is activated
after visiting a file.  `C-c C-c' with the cursor in a line starting
with `#+' is simply restarting Org-mode for the current buffer.


File: org,  Node: Faces for TODO keywords,  Prev: Per file keywords,  Up: TODO extensions

5.2.6 Faces for TODO keywords
-----------------------------

Org-mode highlights TODO keywords with special faces: `org-todo' for
keywords indicating that an item still has to be acted upon, and
`org-done' for keywords indicating that an item is finished.  If you
are using more than 2 different states, you might want to use special
faces for some of them.  This can be done using the variable
`org-todo-keyword-faces'.  For example:

     (setq org-todo-keyword-faces
           '(("TODO"      . org-warning)
             ("DEFERRED"  . shadow)
             ("CANCELED"  . (:foreground "blue" :weight bold))))


File: org,  Node: Progress logging,  Next: Priorities,  Prev: TODO extensions,  Up: TODO items

5.3 Progress Logging
====================

Org-mode can automatically record a time stamp and even a note when you
mark a TODO item as DONE, or even each time you change the state of a
TODO item.

* Menu:

* Closing items::               When was this entry marked DONE?
* Tracking TODO state changes::  When did the status change?


File: org,  Node: Closing items,  Next: Tracking TODO state changes,  Prev: Progress logging,  Up: Progress logging

5.3.1 Closing items
-------------------

If you want to keep track of _when_ a certain TODO item was finished,
turn on logging with(1)

     (setq org-log-done t)

Then each time you turn a TODO entry into DONE using either `C-c C-t'
in the Org-mode buffer or `t' in the agenda buffer, a line `CLOSED:
[timestamp]' will be inserted just after the headline.  If you turn the
entry back into a TODO item through further state cycling, that line
will be removed again.  In the timeline (*note Timeline::) and in the
agenda (*note Weekly/Daily agenda::), you can then use the `l' key to
display the TODO items closed on each day, giving you an overview of
what has been done on a day.  If you want to record a note along with
the timestamp, use(2)

     (setq org-log-done '(done))

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The corresponding in-buffer setting is: `#+STARTUP: logdone'.
You may also set this for the scope of a subtree by adding a `LOGGING'
property with one or more of the logging keywords in the value.

   (2) The corresponding in-buffer setting is: `#+STARTUP: lognotedone'


File: org,  Node: Tracking TODO state changes,  Prev: Closing items,  Up: Progress logging

5.3.2 Tracking TODO state changes
---------------------------------

When TODO keywords are used as workflow states (*note Workflow
states::), you might want to keep track of when a state change occurred
and record a note about this change.  With the setting(1)

     (setq org-log-done '(state))

each state change will prompt you for a note that will be attached to
the current headline.  If you press `C-c C-c' without typing anything
into the note buffer, only the time of the state change will be noted.
Very likely you do not want this verbose tracking all the time, so it
is probably better to configure this behavior with in-buffer options.
For example, if you are tracking purchases, put these into a separate
file that contains:

     #+SEQ_TODO: TODO(t) ORDERED(o) INVOICE(i) PAYED(p) | RECEIVED(r)
     #+STARTUP: lognotestate

   If you only need to take a note for some of the states, mark those
states with an additional `@', like this:

     #+SEQ_TODO: TODO(t) ORDERED(o@) INVOICE(i@) PAYED(p) | RECEIVED(r)
     #+STARTUP: lognotestate

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The corresponding in-buffer setting is: `#+STARTUP:
lognotestate'.


File: org,  Node: Priorities,  Next: Breaking down tasks,  Prev: Progress logging,  Up: TODO items

5.4 Priorities
==============

If you use Org-mode extensively to organize your work, you may end up
with a number of TODO entries so large that you'd like to prioritize
them.  This can be done by placing a _priority cookie_ into the
headline, like this

     *** TODO [#A] Write letter to Sam Fortune

With its standard setup, Org-mode supports priorities `A', `B', and
`C'.  `A' is the highest priority.  An entry without a cookie is
treated as priority `B'.  Priorities make a difference only in the
agenda (*note Weekly/Daily agenda::).

`C-c ,'
     Set the priority of the current headline.  The command prompts for
     a priority character `A', `B' or `C'.  When you press <SPC>
     instead, the priority cookie is removed from the headline.  The
     priorities can also be changed "remotely" from the timeline and
     agenda buffer with the `,' command (*note Agenda commands::).  

`S-<up>'
`S-<down>'
     Increase/decrease priority of current headline(1).  Note that these
     keys are also used to modify time stamps (*note Creating
     timestamps::).  Furthermore, these keys are also used by CUA-mode
     (*note Conflicts::).

   You can change the range of allowed priorities by setting the
variables `org-highest-priority', `org-lowest-priority', and
`org-default-priority'.  For an individual buffer, you may set these
values (highest, lowest, default) like this (please make sure that the
highest priority is earlier in the alphabet than the lowest priority):

     #+PRIORITIES: A C B

File: org,  Node: Breaking down tasks,  Next: Checkboxes,  Prev: Priorities,  Up: TODO items

5.5 Breaking tasks down into subtasks
=====================================

It is often advisable to break down large tasks into smaller, manageable
subtasks.  You can do this by creating an outline tree below a TODO
item, with detailed subtasks on the tree(1).  Another possibility is
the use of checkboxes to identify (a hierarchy of) a large number of
subtasks (*note Checkboxes::).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) To keep subtasks out of the global TODO list, see the
`org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels'.


File: org,  Node: Checkboxes,  Prev: Breaking down tasks,  Up: TODO items

5.6 Checkboxes
==============

Every item in a plain list (*note Plain lists::) can be made a checkbox
by starting it with the string `[ ]'.  This feature is similar to TODO
items (*note TODO items::), but more lightweight.  Checkboxes are not
included into the global TODO list, so they are often great to split a
task into a number of simple steps.  Or you can use them in a shopping
list.  To toggle a checkbox, use `C-c C-c', or try Piotr Zielinski's
`org-mouse.el'.  Here is an example of a checkbox list.

     * TODO Organize party [3/6]
       - call people [1/3]
         - [ ] Peter
         - [X] Sarah
         - [ ] Sam
       - [X] order food
       - [ ] think about what music to play
       - [X] talk to the neighbors

   The `[3/6]' and `[1/3]' in the first and second line are cookies
indicating how many checkboxes are present in this entry, and how many
of them have been checked off.  This can give you an idea on how many
checkboxes remain, even without opening a folded entry.  The cookies
can be placed into a headline or into (the first line of) a plain list
item. Each cookie covers all checkboxes structurally below that
headline/item.  You have to insert the cookie yourself by typing either
`[/]' or `[%]'.  In the first case you get an `n out of m' result, in
the second case you get information about the percentage of checkboxes
checked (in the above example, this would be `[50%]' and `[33%],
respectively').

The following commands work with checkboxes:

`C-c C-c'
     Toggle checkbox at point.  With prefix argument, set it to `[-]',
     which is considered to be an intermediate state.  

`C-c C-x C-b'
     Toggle checkbox at point.
        - If there is an active region, toggle the first checkbox in
          the region and set all remaining boxes to the same status as
          the first.  If you want to toggle all boxes in the region
          independently, use a prefix argument.

        - If the cursor is in a headline, toggle checkboxes in the
          region between this headline and the next (so _not_ the
          entire subtree).

        - If there is no active region, just toggle the checkbox at
          point.
     
`M-S-<RET>'
     Insert a new item with a checkbox.  This works only if the cursor
     is already in a plain list item (*note Plain lists::).  

`C-c #'
     Update the checkbox statistics in the current outline entry.  When
     called with a `C-u' prefix, update the entire file.  Checkbox
     statistic cookies are updated automatically if you toggle
     checkboxes with `C-c C-c' and make new ones with `M-S-<RET>'.  If
     you delete boxes or add/change them by hand, use this command to
     get things back into synch.  Or simply toggle any checkbox twice
     with `C-c C-c'.

6 Tags
******

If you wish to implement a system of labels and contexts for
cross-correlating information, an excellent way is to assign tags to
headlines.  Org-mode has extensive support for using tags.

   Every headline can contain a list of tags, at the end of the
headline.  Tags are normal words containing letters, numbers, `_', and
`@'.  Tags must be preceded and followed by a single colon; like
`:WORK:'.  Several tags can be specified like `:work:URGENT:'.

* Menu:

* Tag inheritance::             Tags use the tree structure of the outline
* Setting tags::                How to assign tags to a headline
* Tag searches::                Searching for combinations of tags


File: org,  Node: Tag inheritance,  Next: Setting tags,  Prev: Tags,  Up: Tags

6.1 Tag inheritance
===================

Tags make use of the hierarchical structure of outline trees.  If a
heading has a certain tag, all subheadings will inherit the tag as
well.  For example, in the list

     * Meeting with the French group      :work:
     ** Summary by Frank                  :boss:notes:
     *** TODO Prepare slides for him      :action:

the final heading will have the tags `:work:', `:boss:', `:notes:', and
`:action:'.  When executing tag searches and Org-mode finds that a
certain headline matches the search criterion, it will not check any
sublevel headline, assuming that these likely also match, and that the
list of matches can become very long.  This may not be what you want,
however, and you can influence inheritance and searching using the
variables `org-use-tag-inheritance' and `org-tags-match-list-sublevels'.


File: org,  Node: Setting tags,  Next: Tag searches,  Prev: Tag inheritance,  Up: Tags

6.2 Setting tags
================

Tags can simply be typed into the buffer at the end of a headline.
After a colon, `M-<TAB>' offers completion on tags.  There is also a
special command for inserting tags:

`C-c C-c'
     Enter new tags for the current headline.  Org-mode will either
     offer completion or a special single-key interface for setting
     tags, see below.  After pressing <RET>, the tags will be inserted
     and aligned to `org-tags-column'.  When called with a `C-u'
     prefix, all tags in the current buffer will be aligned to that
     column, just to make things look nice.  TAGS are automatically
     realigned after promotion, demotion, and TODO state changes (*note
     TODO basics::).

   Org will support tag insertion based on a _list of tags_.  By
default this list is constructed dynamically, containing all tags
currently used in the buffer.  You may also globally specify a hard list
of tags with the variable `org-tag-alist'.  Finally you can set the
default tags for a given file with lines like

     #+TAGS: @work @home @tennisclub
     #+TAGS: laptop car pc sailboat

   If you have globally defined your preferred set of tags using the
variable `org-tag-alist', but would like to use a dynamic tag list in a
specific file: Just add an empty TAGS option line to that file:

     #+TAGS:

   The default support method for entering tags is minibuffer
completion.  However, Org-mode also implements a much better method:
_fast tag selection_.  This method allows to select and deselect tags
with a single key per tag.  To function efficiently, you should assign
unique keys to most tags.  This can be done globally with

     (setq org-tag-alist '(("@work" . ?w) ("@home" . ?h) ("laptop" . ?l)))

or on a per-file basis with

     #+TAGS: @work(w)  @home(h)  @tennisclub(t)  laptop(l)  pc(p)

You can also group together tags that are mutually exclusive.  With
curly braces(1)

     #+TAGS: { @work(w)  @home(h)  @tennisclub(t) }  laptop(l)  pc(p)

you indicate that at most one of `@work', `@home', and `@tennisclub'
should be selected.

Don't forget to press `C-c C-c' with the cursor in one of these lines
to activate any changes.

   If at least one tag has a selection key, pressing `C-c C-c' will
automatically present you with a special interface, listing inherited
tags, the tags of the current headline, and a list of all legal tags
with corresponding keys(2).  In this interface, you can use the
following keys:

`a-z...'
     Pressing keys assigned to tags will add or remove them from the
     list of tags in the current line.  Selecting a tag in a group of
     mutually exclusive tags will turn off any other tags from that
     group.  

`<TAB>'
     Enter a tag in the minibuffer, even if the tag is not in the
     predefined list.  You will be able to complete on all tags present
     in the buffer.  

`<SPC>'
     Clear all tags for this line.  

`<RET>'
     Accept the modified set.

`C-g'
     Abort without installing changes.

`q'
     If `q' is not assigned to a tag, it aborts like `C-g'.

`!'
     Turn off groups of mutually exclusive tags.  Use this to (as an
     exception) assign several tags from such a group.

`C-c'
     Toggle auto-exit after the next change (see below).  If you are
     using expert mode, the first `C-c' will display the selection
     window.

This method lets you assign tags to a headline with very few keys.  With
the above setup, you could clear the current tags and set `@home',
`laptop' and `pc' tags with just the following keys: `C-c C-c <SPC> h l
p <RET>'.  Switching from `@home' to `@work' would be done with `C-c
C-c w <RET>' or alternatively with `C-c C-c C-c w'.  Adding the
non-predefined tag `Sarah' could be done with `C-c C-c <TAB> S a r a h
<RET> <RET>'.

   If you find that most of the time, you need only a single keypress to
modify your list of tags, set the variable
`org-fast-tag-selection-single-key'.  Then you no longer have to press
<RET> to exit fast tag selection - it will immediately exit after the
first change.  If you then occasionally need more keys, press `C-c' to
turn off auto-exit for the current tag selection process (in effect:
start selection with `C-c C-c C-c' instead of `C-c C-c').  If you set
the variable to the value `expert', the special window is not even
shown for single-key tag selection, it comes up only when you press an
extra `C-c'.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) In `org-mode-alist' use `'(:startgroup)' and `'(:endgroup)',
respectively.  Several groups are allowed.

   (2) Keys will automatically be assigned to tags which have no
configured keys.

6.3 Tag searches
================

Once a tags system has been set up, it can be used to collect related
information into special lists.

`C-c \'
`C-c / T'
     Create a sparse tree with all headlines matching a tags search.
     With a `C-u' prefix argument, ignore headlines that are not a TODO
     line.  

`C-c a m'
     Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files.  *Note
     Matching tags and properties::.  

`C-c a M'
     Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files, but
     check only TODO items and force checking subitems (see variable
     `org-tags-match-list-sublevels').

   A tags search string can use Boolean operators `&' for AND and `|'
for OR.  `&' binds more strongly than `|'.  Parenthesis are currently
not implemented.  A tag may also be preceded by `-', to select against
it, and `+' is syntactic sugar for positive selection.  The AND
operator `&' is optional when `+' or `-' is present.  Examples:

`+work-boss'
     Select headlines tagged `:work:', but discard those also tagged
     `:boss:'.

`work|laptop'
     Selects lines tagged `:work:' or `:laptop:'.

`work|laptop&night'
     Like before, but require the `:laptop:' lines to be tagged also
     `night'.

   If you are using multi-state TODO keywords (*note TODO
extensions::), it can be useful to also match on the TODO keyword.
This can be done by adding a condition after a slash to a tags match.
The syntax is similar to the tag matches, but should be applied with
consideration: For example, a positive selection on several TODO
keywords can not meaningfully be combined with boolean AND.  However,
_negative selection_ combined with AND can be meaningful.  To make sure
that only lines are checked that actually have any TODO keyword, use
`C-c a M', or equivalently start the todo part after the slash with `!'.
Examples:

`work/WAITING'
     Select `:work:'-tagged TODO lines with the specific TODO keyword
     `WAITING'.

`work/!-WAITING-NEXT'
     Select `:work:'-tagged TODO lines that are neither `WAITING' nor
     `NEXT'

`work/+WAITING|+NEXT'
     Select `:work:'-tagged TODO lines that are either `WAITING' or
     `NEXT'.

   Any element of the tag/todo match can be a regular expression - in
this case it must be enclosed in curly braces.  For example,
`work+{^boss.*}' matches headlines that contain the tag `work' and any
tag starting with `boss'.

   You can also require a headline to be of a certain level or
category, by writing instead of any TAG an expression like `LEVEL=3' or
`CATEGORY="work"', respectively.  For example, a search
`+LEVEL=3+boss/-DONE' lists all level three headlines that have the tag
`boss' and are _not_ marked with the todo keyword DONE.

7 Properties and Columns
************************

Properties are a set of key-value pairs associated with an entry.  There
are two main applications for properties in Org-mode.  First, properties
are like tags, but with a value.  For example, in a file where you
document bugs and plan releases of a piece of software, instead of using
tags like `:release_1:', `:release_2:', it can be more efficient to use
a property `Release' with a value `1.0' or `2.0'.  Second, you can use
properties to implement (very basic) database capabilities in an
Org-mode buffer, for example to create a list of Music CD's you own.
You can edit and view properties conveniently in column view (*note
Column view::).

File: org,  Node: Property syntax,  Next: Special properties,  Prev: Properties and columns,  Up: Properties and columns

7.1 Property Syntax
===================

Properties are key-value pairs.  They need to be inserted into a special
drawer (*note Drawers::) with the name `PROPERTIES'.  Each property is
specified on a single line, with the key (surrounded by colons) first,
and the value after it.  Here is an example:

     * CD collection
     ** Classic
     *** Goldberg Variations
         :PROPERTIES:
         :Title:     Goldberg Variations
         :Composer:  J.S. Bach
         :Artist:    Glen Gould
         :Publisher: Deutsche Grammphon
         :NDisks:    1
         :END:

   You may define the allowed values for a particular property `Xyz' by
setting a property `Xyz_ALL'.  This special property is _inherited_, so
if you set it in a level 1 entry, it will apply to the entire tree.
When allowed values are defined, setting the corresponding property
becomes easier and is less prone to typing errors.  For the example
with the CD collection, we can predefine publishers and the number of
disks in a box like this:

     * CD collection
       :PROPERTIES:
       :NDisks_ALL:  1 2 3 4
       :Publisher_ALL: "Deutsche Grammophon" Phillips EMI
       :END:

   If you want to set properties that can be inherited by any entry in a
file, use a line like

     #+PROPERTY: NDisks_ALL 1 2 3 4

   Property values set with the global variable `org-global-properties'
can be inherited by all entries in all Org-mode files.

The following commands help to work with properties:

`M-<TAB>'
     After an initial colon in a line, complete property keys.  All
     keys used in the current file will be offered as possible
     completions.  

`C-c C-x p'
     Set a property.  This prompts for a property name and a value.  If
     necessary, the property drawer is created as well.

`M-x org-insert-property-drawer'
     Insert a property drawer into the current entry.  The drawer will
     be inserted early in the entry, but after the lines with planning
     information like deadlines.  

`C-c C-c'
     With the cursor in a property drawer, this executes property
     commands.

`C-c C-c s'
     Set a property in the current entry.  Both the property and the
     value can be inserted using completion.  

`S-<left>/<right>'
     Switch property at point to the next/previous allowed value.

`C-c C-c d'
     Remove a property from the current entry.

`C-c C-c D'
     Globally remove a property, from all entries in the current file.

`C-c C-c c'
     Compute the property at point, using the operator and scope from
     the nearest column format definition.

7.2 Special Properties
======================

Special properties provide alternative access method to Org-mode
features discussed in the previous chapters, like the TODO state or the
priority of an entry.  This interface exists so that you can include
these states into columns view (*note Column view::), or to use them in
queries.  The following property names are special and should not be
used as keys in the properties drawer:

     TODO         The TODO keyword of the entry.
     TAGS         The tags defined directly in the headline.
     ALLTAGS      All tags, including inherited ones.
     PRIORITY     The priority of the entry, a string with a single letter.
     DEADLINE     The deadline time string, without the angular brackets.
     SCHEDULED    The scheduling time stamp, without the angular brackets.
     TIMESTAMP    The first keyword-less time stamp in the entry.
     TIMESTAMP_IA The first inactive time stamp in the entry.


File: org,  Node: Property searches,  Next: Property inheritance,  Prev: Special properties,  Up: Properties and columns

7.3 Property searches
=====================

To create sparse trees and special lists with selection based on
properties, the same commands are used as for tag searches (*note Tag
searches::), and the same logic applies.  For example, a search string

     +work-boss+PRIORITY="A"+Coffee="unlimited"+With={Sarah\|Denny}

finds entries tagged `:work:' but not `:boss:', which also have a
priority value `A', a `:Coffee:' property with the value `unlimited',
and a `:With:' property that is matched by the regular expression
`Sarah\|Denny'.

   You can configure Org-mode to use property inheritance during a
search, see *Note Property inheritance:: for details.

   There is also a special command for creating sparse trees based on a
single property:

`C-c / p'
     Create a sparse tree based on the value of a property.  This first
     prompts for the name of a property, and then for a value.  A
     sparse tree is created with all entries that define this property
     with the given value.  If you enclose the value into curly braces,
     it is interpreted as a regular expression and matched against the
     property values.


File: org,  Node: Property inheritance,  Next: Column view,  Prev: Property searches,  Up: Properties and columns

7.4 Property Inheritance
========================

The outline structure of Org-mode documents lends itself for an
inheritance model of properties: If the parent in a tree has a certain
property, the children can inherit this property.  Org-mode does not
turn this on by default, because it can slow down property searches
significantly and is often not needed.  However, if you find inheritance
useful, you can turn it on by setting the variable
`org-use-property-inheritance'.  It may be set to `t', to make all
properties inherited from the parent, or to a list of properties that
should be inherited.

   Org-mode has a few properties for which inheritance is hard-coded, at
least for the special applications for which they are used:

`COLUMNS'
     The column property defines the format of column view (*note
     Column view::).  It is inherited in the sense that the level where
     a `COLUMNS' property is defined is used as the starting point for a
     column view table, independently of the location in the subtree
     from where columns view is turned on.

`CATEGORY'
     For agenda view, a category set through a `CATEGORY' property
     applies to the entire subtree.

`ARCHIVE'
     For archiving, the `ARCHIVE' property may define the archive
     location for the entire subtree (*note Moving subtrees::).


File: org,  Node: Column view,  Next: Property API,  Prev: Property inheritance,  Up: Properties and columns

7.5 Column View
===============

A great way to view and edit properties in an outline tree is _column
view_.  In column view, each outline item is turned into a table row.
Columns in this table provide access to properties of the entries.
Org-mode implements columns by overlaying a tabular structure over the
headline of each item.  While the headlines have been turned into a
table row, you can still change the visibility of the outline tree.
For example, you get a compact table by switching to CONTENTS view
(`S-<TAB> S-<TAB>', or simply `c' while column view is active), but you
can still open, read, and edit the entry below each headline.  Or, you
can switch to column view after executing a sparse tree command and in
this way get a table only for the selected items.  Column view also
works in agenda buffers (*note Agenda views::) where queries have
collected selected items, possibly from a number of files.

File: org,  Node: Defining columns,  Next: Using column view,  Prev: Column view,  Up: Column view

7.5.1 Defining Columns
----------------------

Setting up a column view first requires defining the columns.  This is
done by defining a column format line.

* Menu:

* Scope of column definitions::  Where defined, where valid?
* Column attributes::           Appearance and content of a column


File: org,  Node: Scope of column definitions,  Next: Column attributes,  Prev: Defining columns,  Up: Defining columns

7.5.1.1 Scope of column definitions
...................................

To define a column format for an entire file, use a line like

     #+COLUMNS: %25ITEM %TAGS %PRIORITY %TODO

   To specify a format that only applies to a specific tree, add a
COLUMNS property to the top node of that tree, for example
     ** Top node for columns view
        :PROPERTIES:
        :COLUMNS: %25ITEM %TAGS %PRIORITY %TODO
        :END:

   If a `COLUMNS' property is present in an entry, it defines columns
for the entry itself, and for the entire subtree below it.  Since the
column definition is part of the hierarchical structure of the document,
you can define columns on level 1 that are general enough for all
sublevels, and more specific columns further down, when you edit a
deeper part of the tree.


File: org,  Node: Column attributes,  Prev: Scope of column definitions,  Up: Defining columns

7.5.1.2 Column attributes
.........................

A column definition sets the attributes of a column.  The general
definition looks like this:

      %[width]property[(title)][{summary-type}]

Except for the percent sign and the property name, all items are
optional.  The individual parts have the following meaning:

     width           An integer specifying the width of the column in characters.
                     If omitted, the width will be determined automatically.
     property        The property that should be edited in this column.
     (title)         The header text for the column. If omitted, the
                     property name is used.
     {summary-type}  The summary type.  If specified, the column values for
                     parent nodes are computed from the children.
                     Supported summary types are:
                     {+}       Sum numbers in this column.
                     {+;%.1f}  Like `+', but format result with `%.1f'.
                     {$}       Currency, short for `+;%.2f'.
                     {:}       Sum times, HH:MM:SS, plain numbers are hours.
                     {X}       Checkbox status, [X] if all children are [X].

Here is an example for a complete columns definition, along with allowed
values.

     :COLUMNS:  %20ITEM %9Approved(Approved?){X} %Owner %11Status %10Time_Spent{:}
     :Owner_ALL:    Tammy Mark Karl Lisa Don
     :Status_ALL:   "In progress" "Not started yet" "Finished" ""
     :Approved_ALL: "[ ]" "[X]"

   The first column, `%25ITEM', means the first 25 characters of the
item itself, i.e. of the headline.  You probably always should start the
column definition with the ITEM specifier.  The other specifiers create
columns `Owner' with a list of names as allowed values, for `Status'
with four different possible values, and for a checkbox field
`Approved'.  When no width is given after the `%' character, the column
will be exactly as wide as it needs to be in order to fully display all
values.  The `Approved' column does have a modified title (`Approved?',
with a question mark).  Summaries will be created for the `Time_Spent'
column by adding time duration expressions like HH:MM, and for the
`Approved' column, by providing an `[X]' status if all children have
been checked.


File: org,  Node: Using column view,  Next: Capturing Column View,  Prev: Defining columns,  Up: Column view

7.5.2 Using Column View
-----------------------

Turning column view on and off
..............................

`C-c C-x C-c'
     Create the column view for the local environment.  This command
     searches the hierarchy, up from point, for a `COLUMNS' property
     that defines a format.  When one is found, the column view table
     is established for the entire tree, starting from the entry that
     contains the `COLUMNS' property.  If none is found, the format is
     taken from the `#+COLUMNS' line or from the variable
     `org-columns-default-format', and column view is established for
     the current entry and its subtree.  

`q'
     Exit column view.

Editing values
..............

`<left> <right> <up> <down>'
     Move through the column view from field to field.  

`S-<left>/<right>'
     Switch to the next/previous allowed value of the field.  For this,
     you have to have specified allowed values for a property.  

`n / p'
     Same as `S-<left>/<right>' 

`e'
     Edit the property at point.  For the special properties, this will
     invoke the same interface that you normally use to change that
     property.  For example, when editing a TAGS property, the tag
     completion or fast selection interface will pop up.  

`C-c C-c'
     When there is a checkbox at point, toggle it.  

`v'
     View the full value of this property.  This is useful if the width
     of the column is smaller than that of the value.  

`a'
     Edit the list of allowed values for this property.  If the list is
     found in the hierarchy, the modified values is stored there.  If
     no list is found, the new value is stored in the first entry that
     is part of the current column view.

Modifying the table structure
.............................

`< / >'
     Make the column narrower/wider by one character.  

`S-M-<right>'
     Insert a new column, to the right of the current column.  

`S-M-<left>'
     Delete the current column.


File: org,  Node: Capturing Column View,  Prev: Using column view,  Up: Column view

7.5.3 Capturing Column View
---------------------------

Since column view is just an overlay over a buffer, it cannot be
exported or printed directly.  If you want to capture a column view, use
the dynamic block (*note Dynamic blocks::).  The frame of this block
looks like this:

     * The column view
     #+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id "label"

     #+END:

This dynamic block has the following parameters:

`:id'
     This is most important parameter.  Column view is a feature that is
     often localized to a certain (sub)tree, and the capture block
     might be in a different location in the file.  To identify the
     tree whose view to capture, you can use 3 values:
          local     use the tree in which the capture block is located
          global    make a global view, including all headings in the file
          "label"   call column view in the tree that has and `:ID:'
                    property with the value label

`:hlines'
     When `t', insert a hline after every line.  When a number N, insert
     a hline before each headline with level `<= N'.

`:vlines'
     When set to `t', enforce column groups to get vertical lines.

The following commands insert or update the dynamic block:

`C-c C-x r'
     Insert a dynamic block capturing a column view.  You will be
     prompted for the scope or id of the view.  

`C-c C-c'
`C-c C-x C-u'
     Update dynamical block at point.  The cursor needs to be in the
     `#+BEGIN' line of the dynamic block.  

`C-u C-c C-x C-u'
     Update all dynamic blocks (*note Dynamic blocks::).  This is
     useful if you have several clocktable blocks in a buffer.

7.6 The Property API
====================

There is a full API for accessing and changing properties.  This API can
be used by Emacs Lisp programs to work with properties and to implement
features based on them.  For more information see *Note Using the
property API::.

8 Dates and Times
*****************

Items can be labeled with a date and/or a time to make them useful for
project planning.  The specially formatted string carrying the date and
time information is called a _timestamp_ in Org-mode.  This may be a
little confusing because timestamp is often used as indicating when
something was created or last changed.  However, in Org-mode this term
is used in a much wider sense.

* Clocking work time::


File: org,  Node: Time stamps,  Next: Creating timestamps,  Prev: Dates and times,  Up: Dates and times

8.1 Time stamps, deadlines and scheduling
=========================================

A time stamp is a specification of a date (possibly with time or a range
of times) in a special format, either `<2003-09-16 Tue>' or
`<2003-09-16 Tue 09:39>' or `<2003-09-16 Tue 12:00-12:30>'(1).  A time
stamp can appear anywhere in the headline or body of an org-tree entry.
Its presence causes entries to be shown on specific dates in the agenda
(*note Weekly/Daily agenda::).  We distinguish:

PLAIN TIME STAMP; EVENT; APPOINTMENT
     A simple time stamp just assigns a date/time to an item.  This is
     just like writing down an appointment or event in a paper agenda.
     In the timeline and agenda displays, the headline of an entry
     associated with a plain time stamp will be shown exactly on that
     date.

          * Meet Peter at the movies <2006-11-01 Wed 19:15>
          * Discussion on climate change <2006-11-02 Thu 20:00-22:00>

TIME STAMP WITH REPEATER INTERVAL
     A time stamp may contain a _repeater interval_, indicating that it
     applies not only on the given date, but again and again after a
     certain interval of N days (d), weeks (w), months(m), or years(y).
     The following will show up in the agenda every Wednesday:

          * Pick up Sam at school <2007-05-16 Wed 12:30 +1w>

DIARY-STYLE SEXP ENTRIES
     For more complex date specifications, Org-mode supports using the
     special sexp diary entries implemented in the Emacs calendar/diary
     package.  For example

          * The nerd meeting on every 2nd Thursday of the month
            <%%(diary-float t 4 2)>

TIME/DATE RANGE
     Two time stamps connected by `--' denote a range.  The headline
     will be shown on the first and last day of the range, and on any
     dates that are displayed and fall in the range.  Here is an
     example:

          ** Meeting in Amsterdam
             <2004-08-23 Mon>--<2004-08-26 Thu>

INACTIVE TIME STAMP
     Just like a plain time stamp, but with square brackets instead of
     angular ones.  These time stamps are inactive in the sense that
     they do _not_ trigger an entry to show up in the agenda.

          * Gillian comes late for the fifth time [2006-11-01 Wed]

used to these, see *Note Custom time format::

8.2 Creating timestamps
=======================

For Org-mode to recognize time stamps, they need to be in the specific
format.  All commands listed below produce time stamps in the correct
format.

`C-c .'
     Prompt for a date and insert a corresponding time stamp.  When the
     cursor is at a previously used time stamp, it is updated to NOW.
     When this command is used twice in succession, a time range is
     inserted.  

`C-u C-c .'
     Like `C-c .', but use the alternative format which contains date
     and time.  The default time can be rounded to multiples of 5
     minutes, see the option `org-time-stamp-rounding-minutes'.  

`C-c !'
     Like `C-c .', but insert an inactive time stamp that will not cause
     an agenda entry.  

`C-c <'
     Insert a time stamp corresponding to the cursor date in the
     Calendar.  

`C-c >'
     Access the Emacs calendar for the current date.  If there is a
     timestamp in the current line, goto the corresponding date instead.  

`C-c C-o'
     Access the agenda for the date given by the time stamp or -range at
     point (*note Weekly/Daily agenda::).  

`S-<left>'
`S-<right>'
     Change date at cursor by one day.  These key bindings conflict with
     CUA-mode (*note Conflicts::).  

`S-<up>'
`S-<down>'
     Change the item under the cursor in a timestamp.  The cursor can
     be on a year, month, day, hour or minute.  Note that if the cursor
     is in a headline and not at a time stamp, these same keys modify
     the priority of an item.  (*note Priorities::). The key bindings
     also conflict with CUA-mode (*note Conflicts::).  

`C-c C-y'
     Evaluate a time range by computing the difference between start and
     end.  With prefix arg, insert result after the time range (in a
     table: into the following column).

8.2.1 The date/time prompt
--------------------------

When Org-mode prompts for a date/time, the default is shown as an ISO
date, and the prompt therefore seems to ask for an ISO date.  But it
will in fact accept any string containing some date and/or time
information, and it is really smart about interpreting your input.  You
can, for example, use `C-y' to paste a (possibly multi-line) string
copied from an email message.  Org-mode will find whatever information
is in there and derive anything you have not specified from the
_default date and time_.  The default is usually the current date and
time, but when modifying an existing time stamp, or when entering the
second stamp of a range, it is taken from the stamp in the buffer.
When filling in information, Org-mode assumes that most of the time you
will want to enter a date in the future: If you omit the month/year and
the given day/month is before today, it will assume that you mean a
future date(1).

   For example, lets assume that today is June 13, 2006.  Here is how
various inputs will be interpreted, the items filled in by Org-mode are
in bold.

     3-2-5         --> 2003-02-05
     14            --> 2006-06-14
     12            --> 2006-07-12
     Fri           --> nearest Friday (defaultdate or later)
     sep 15        --> 2006-11-15
     feb 15        --> 2007-02-15
     sep 12 9      --> 2009-09-12
     12:45         --> 2006-06-13 12:45
     22 sept 0:34  --> 2006-09-22 0:34

   Furthermore you can specify a relative date by giving, as the
_first_ thing in the input: a plus/minus sign, a number and a letter
[dwmy] to indicate change in days weeks, months, years.  With a single
plus or minus, the date is always relative to today.  With a double
plus or minus, it is relative to the default date.  If instead of a
single letter, you use the abbreviation of day name, the date will be
the nth such day.  E.g.

     +4d           --> four days from today
     +4            --> same as above
     +2w           --> two weeks from today
     ++5           --> five days from default date
     +2tue         --> second tuesday from now.

   The function understands English month and weekday abbreviations.  If
you want to use unabbreviated names and/or other languages, configure
the variables `parse-time-months' and `parse-time-weekdays'.

   Parallel to the minibuffer prompt, a calendar is popped up(2).  When
you exit the date prompt, either by clicking on a date in the calendar,
or by pressing <RET>, the date selected in the calendar will be
combined with the information entered at the prompt.  You can control
the calendar fully from the minibuffer:

     > / <          Scroll calendar forward/backward by one month.
     mouse-1        Select date by clicking on it.
     S-<right>/<left>     One day forward/backward.
     S-<down>/<up>     One week forward/backward.
     M-S-<right>/<left>   One month forward/backward.
     <RET>           Choose date in calendar.

   The actions of the date/time prompt may seem complex, but I asure you
they will grow on you.  To help you understand what is going on, the
current interpretation of your input will be displayed live in the
minibuffer(3).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) See the variable `org-read-date-prefer-future'.

   (2) If you don't need/want the calendar, configure the variable
`org-popup-calendar-for-date-prompt'.

   (3) If you find this distracting, turn the display of with
`org-read-date-display-live'.


File: org,  Node: Custom time format,  Prev: The date/time prompt,  Up: Creating timestamps

8.2.2 Custom time format
------------------------

Org-mode uses the standard ISO notation for dates and times as it is
defined in ISO 8601.  If you cannot get used to this and require another
representation of date and time to keep you happy, you can get it by
customizing the variables `org-display-custom-times' and
`org-time-stamp-custom-formats'.

`C-c C-x C-t'
     Toggle the display of custom formats for dates and times.

Org-mode needs the default format for scanning, so the custom date/time
format does not _replace_ the default format - instead it is put _over_
the default format using text properties.  This has the following
consequences:
   * You cannot place the cursor onto a time stamp anymore, only before
     or after.

   * The `S-<up>/<down>' keys can no longer be used to adjust each
     component of a time stamp.  If the cursor is at the beginning of
     the stamp, `S-<up>/<down>' will change the stamp by one day, just
     like `S-<left>/<right>'.  At the end of the stamp, the time will
     be changed by one minute.

   * If the time stamp contains a range of clock times or a repeater,
     these will not be overlayed, but remain in the buffer as they were.

   * When you delete a time stamp character-by-character, it will only
     disappear from the buffer after _all_ (invisible) characters
     belonging to the ISO timestamp have been removed.

   * If the custom time stamp format is longer than the default and you
     are using dates in tables, table alignment will be messed up.  If
     the custom format is shorter, things do work as expected.

8.3 Deadlines and Scheduling
============================

A time stamp may be preceded by special keywords to facilitate planning
of work:

DEADLINE
     The task (most likely a TODO item) is supposed to be finished on
     that date, and it will be listed then.  In addition, the
     compilation for _today_ will carry a warning about the approaching
     or missed deadline, starting `org-deadline-warning-days' before
     the due date, and continuing until the entry is marked DONE.  An
     example:

          *** TODO write article about the Earth for the Guide
              The editor in charge is [[bbdb:Ford Prefect]]
              DEADLINE: <2004-02-29 Sun>

     You can specify a different lead time for warnings for a specific
     deadlines using the following syntax.  Here is an example with a
     warning period of 5 days `DEADLINE: <2004-02-29 Sun -5d>'.

SCHEDULED
     You are planning to start working on that task on the given date.
     The headline will be listed under the given date(1).  In addition,
     a reminder that the scheduled date has passed will be present in
     the compilation for _today_, until the entry is marked DONE.
     I.e., the task will automatically be forwarded until completed.

          *** TODO Call Trillian for a date on New Years Eve.
              SCHEDULED: <2004-12-25 Sat>

     Important: Scheduling an item in Org-mode should not be understood
     like Scheduling a meeting.  Setting a date for a meeting is just a
     simple appointment, you should mark this entry with a simple plain
     time stamp, to get this item shown on the date where it applies.
     This is a frequent mis-understanding from Org-users.  In Org-mode,
     Scheduling means setting a date when you want to start working on
     an action item.

* Menu:

* Inserting deadline/schedule::  Planning items
* Repeated tasks::              Items that show up again and again

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) It will still be listed on that date after it has been marked
DONE.  If you don't like this, set the variable
`org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done'.


File: org,  Node: Inserting deadline/schedule,  Next: Repeated tasks,  Prev: Deadlines and scheduling,  Up: Deadlines and scheduling

8.3.1 Inserting deadline/schedule
---------------------------------

The following commands allow to quickly insert a deadline or to schedule
an item:

`C-c C-d'
     Insert `DEADLINE' keyword along with a stamp.  The insertion will
     happen in the line directly following the headline.  When called
     with a prefix arg, an existing deadline will be removed from the
     entry.  

`C-c / d'
     Create a sparse tree with all deadlines that are either past-due,
     or which will become due within `org-deadline-warning-days'.  With
     `C-u' prefix, show all deadlines in the file.  With a numeric
     prefix, check that many days.  For example, `C-1 C-c / d' shows
     all deadlines due tomorrow.  

`C-c C-s'
     Insert `SCHEDULED' keyword along with a stamp.  The insertion will
     happen in the line directly following the headline.  Any CLOSED
     timestamp will be removed.  When called with a prefix argument,
     remove the scheduling date from the entry.


File: org,  Node: Repeated tasks,  Prev: Inserting deadline/schedule,  Up: Deadlines and scheduling

8.3.2 Repeated Tasks
--------------------

Some tasks need to be repeated again and again, and Org-mode therefore
allows to use a repeater in a DEADLINE or SCHEDULED time stamp, for
example:
     ** TODO Pay the rent
        DEADLINE: <2005-10-01 Sat +1m>

   Deadlines and scheduled items produce entries in the agenda when they
are over-due, so it is important to be able to mark such an entry as
completed once you have done so.  When you mark a DEADLINE or a SCHEDULE
with the todo keyword DONE, it will no longer produce entries in the
agenda. The problem with this is, however, that then also the _next_
instance of the repeated entry will not be active.  Org-mode deals with
this in the following way: When you try to mark such an entry DONE
(using `C-c C-t'), it will shift the base date of the repeating time
stamp by the repeater interval, and immediately set the entry state
back to TODO.  In the example above, setting the state to DONE would
actually switch the date like this:

     ** TODO Pay the rent
        DEADLINE: <2005-11-01 Tue +1m>

   You will also be prompted for a note(1) that will be put under the
DEADLINE line to keep a record that you actually acted on the previous
instance of this deadline.

   As a consequence of shifting the base date, this entry will no
longer be visible in the agenda when checking past dates, but all
future instances will be visible.

   You may have both scheduling and deadline information for a specific
task - just make sure that the repeater intervals on both are the same.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You can change this using the option `org-log-repeat', or the
`#+STARTUP' options `logrepeat' and `nologrepeat'.


File: org,  Node: Clocking work time,  Prev: Deadlines and scheduling,  Up: Dates and times

8.4 Clocking work time
======================

Org-mode allows you to clock the time you spent on specific tasks in a
project.  When you start working on an item, you can start the clock.
When you stop working on that task, or when you mark the task done, the
clock is stopped and the corresponding time interval is recorded.  It
also computes the total time spent on each subtree of a project.

`C-c C-x C-i'
     Start the clock on the current item (clock-in).  This inserts the
     CLOCK keyword together with a timestamp.  If this is not the first
     clocking of this item, the multiple CLOCK lines will be wrapped
     into a `:CLOCK:' drawer (see also the variable
     `org-clock-into-drawer'.  

`C-c C-x C-o'
     Stop the clock (clock-out).  The inserts another timestamp at the
     same location where the clock was last started.  It also directly
     computes the resulting time in inserts it after the time range as
     `=> HH:MM'.  See the variable `org-log-done' for the possibility to
     record an additional note together with the clock-out time
     stamp(1).  

`C-c C-y'
     Recompute the time interval after changing one of the time stamps.
     This is only necessary if you edit the time stamps directly.  If
     you change them with `S-<cursor>' keys, the update is automatic.  

`C-c C-t'
     Changing the TODO state of an item to DONE automatically stops the
     clock if it is running in this same item.  

`C-c C-x C-x'
     Cancel the current clock.  This is useful if a clock was started by
     mistake, or if you ended up working on something else.  

`C-c C-x C-j'
     Jump to the entry that contains the currently running clock, an
     another window.  

`C-c C-x C-d'
     Display time summaries for each subtree in the current buffer.
     This puts overlays at the end of each headline, showing the total
     time recorded under that heading, including the time of any
     subheadings. You can use visibility cycling to study the tree, but
     the overlays disappear when you change the buffer (see variable
     `org-remove-highlights-with-change') or press `C-c C-c'.  

`C-c C-x C-r'
     Insert a dynamic block (*note Dynamic blocks::) containing a clock
     report as an org-mode table into the current file.  When the
     cursor is at an existing clock table, just update it.  When called
     with a prefix argument, jump to the first clock report in the
     current document and update it.
          #+BEGIN: clocktable :maxlevel 2 :emphasize nil :scope file

          #+END: clocktable
     If such a block already exists at point, its content is replaced
     by the new table.  The `BEGIN' line can specify options:
          :maxlevel    Maximum level depth to which times are listed in the table.
          :emphasize   When `t', emphasize level one and level two items
          :scope       The scope to consider.  This can be any of the following:
                       nil        the current buffer or narrowed region
                       file       the full current buffer
                       subtree    the subtree where the clocktable is located
                       treeN      the surrounding level N tree, for example `tree3'
                       tree       the surrounding level 1 tree
                       agenda     all agenda files
                       ("file"..) scan these files
          :block       The time block to consider.  This block is specified relative
                       to the current time and may be any of these keywords:
                       `today', `yesterday', `thisweek', `lastweek',
                       `thismonth', `lastmonth', `thisyear', or `lastyear'.
          :tstart      A time string specifying when to start considering times
          :tend        A time string specifying when to stop considering times
     So to get a clock summary of the current level 1 tree, for the
     current day, you could write
          #+BEGIN: clocktable :maxlevel 2 :block today :scope tree1

          #+END: clocktable
     and to use a specific time range you could write(2)
          #+BEGIN: clocktable :tstart "<2006-08-10 Thu 10:00>"
                              :tend "<2006-08-10 Thu 12:00>"

          #+END: clocktable
     
`C-c C-c'
`C-c C-x C-u'
     Update dynamical block at point.  The cursor needs to be in the
     `#+BEGIN' line of the dynamic block.  

`C-u C-c C-x C-u'
     Update all dynamic blocks (*note Dynamic blocks::).  This is
     useful if you have several clocktable blocks in a buffer.

   The `l' key may be used in the timeline (*note Timeline::) and in
the agenda (*note Weekly/Daily agenda::) to show which tasks have been
worked on or closed during a day.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The corresponding in-buffer setting is: `#+STARTUP:
lognoteclock-out'

   (2) Note that all parameters must be specified in a single line -
the line is broken here only to fit it onto the manual.

9 Remember
**********

The Remember package by John Wiegley lets you store quick notes with
little interruption of your work flow.  See
`http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/RememberMode' for more
information.  It is an excellent way to add new notes and tasks to
Org-mode files.  Org-mode significantly expands the possibilities of
remember: You may define templates for different note types, and
associate target files and headlines with specific templates.  It also
allows you to select the location where a note should be stored
interactively, on the fly.

* Menu:

* Setting up remember::         Some code for .emacs to get things going
* Remember templates::          Define the outline of different note types
* Storing notes::               Directly get the note to where it belongs
* Refiling notes::              Moving a note or task to a project

9.1 Setting up remember
=======================

The following customization will tell remember to use org files as
target, and to create annotations compatible with Org-mode links.

     (org-remember-insinuate)
     (setq org-directory "~/path/to/my/orgfiles/")
     (setq org-default-notes-file (concat org-directory "/notes.org"))
     (define-key global-map "\C-cr" 'org-remember)

   The last line binds the command `org-remember' to a global key(1).
`org-remember' basically just calls `remember', but it makes a few
things easier: If there is an active region, it will automatically copy
the region into the remember buffer.  It also allows to jump to the
buffer and location where remember notes are being stored: Just call
`org-remember' with a prefix argument.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Please select your own key, `C-c r' is only a suggestion.


File: org,  Node: Remember templates,  Next: Storing notes,  Prev: Setting up remember,  Up: Remember

9.2 Remember templates
======================

In combination with Org-mode, you can use templates to generate
different types of remember notes.  For example, if you would like to
use one template to create general TODO entries, another one for
journal entries, and a third one for collecting random ideas, you could
use:

     (setq org-remember-templates
      '(("Todo" ?t "* TODO %?\n  %i\n  %a" "~/org/TODO.org" "Tasks")
        ("Journal" ?j "* %U %?\n\n  %i\n  %a" "~/org/JOURNAL.org")
        ("Idea" ?i "* %^{Title}\n  %i\n  %a" "~/org/JOURNAL.org" "New Ideas")))

In these entries, the first string is just a name, and the character
specifies how to select the template.  It is useful if the character is
also the first letter of the name.  The next string specifies the
template.  Two more (optional) strings give the file in which, and the
headline under which the new note should be stored.  The file (if not
present or `nil') defaults to `org-default-notes-file', the heading to
`org-remember-default-headline'.

   When you call `M-x remember' (or `M-x org-remember') to remember
something, org will prompt for a key to select the template (if you have
more than one template) and then prepare the buffer like
     * TODO
       [[file:link to where you called remember]]

During expansion of the template, special `%'-escapes allow dynamic
insertion of content:
     %^{prompt}  prompt the user for a string and replace this sequence with it.
     %t          time stamp, date only
     %T          time stamp with date and time
     %u, %U      like the above, but inactive time stamps
     %^t         like `%t', but prompt for date.  Similarly `%^T', `%^u', `%^U'
                 You may define a prompt like `%^{Birthday}t'
     %n          user name (taken from `user-full-name')
     %a          annotation, normally the link created with `org-store-link'
     %A          like `%a', but prompt for the description part
     %i          initial content, the region when remember is called with C-u.
                 The entire text will be indented like `%i' itself.
     %c          Content of the clipboard, or current kill ring head.
     %^g         prompt for tags, with completion on tags in target file.
     %^G         prompt for tags, with completion all tags in all agenda files.
     %:keyword   specific information for certain link types, see below
     %[pathname] insert the contents of the file given by `pathname'
     %(sexp)     evaluate elisp `(sexp)' and replace with the result

For specific link types, the following keywords will be defined(1):

     Link type          |  Available keywords
     -------------------+----------------------------------------------
     bbdb               |  %:name %:company
     vm, wl, mh, rmail  |  %:type %:subject %:message-id
                        |  %:from %:fromname %:fromaddress
                        |  %:to   %:toname   %:toaddress
                        |  %:fromto (either "to NAME" or "from NAME")(2)
     gnus               |  %:group, for messages also all email fields
     w3, w3m            |  %:url
     info               |  %:file %:node
     calendar           |  %:date"

To place the cursor after template expansion use:

     %?          After completing the template, position cursor here.

If you change you mind about which template to use, call `org-remember'
in the remember buffer.  You may then select a new template that will
be filled with the previous context information.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If you define your own link types (*note Adding hyperlink
types::), any property you store with `org-store-link-props' can be
accessed in remember templates in a similar way.

   (2) This will always be the other, not the user.  See the variable
`org-from-is-user-regexp'.

9.3 Storing notes
=================

When you are finished preparing a note with remember, you have to press
`C-c C-c' to file the note away.  The handler will store the note in
the file and under the headline specified in the template, or it will
use the default file and headlines.  The window configuration will be
restored, and you are back in the working context before the call to
`remember'.  To re-use the location found during the last call to
`remember', exit the remember buffer with `C-u C-u C-c C-c', i.e.
specify a double prefix argument to `C-c C-c'.

   If you want to store the note directly to a different place, use
`C-u C-c C-c' instead to exit remember(1).  The handler will then first
prompt for a target file - if you press <RET>, the value specified for
the template is used.  Then the command offers the headings tree of the
selected file, with the cursor position at the default headline (if you
had specified one in the template).  You can either immediately press
<RET> to get the note placed there.  Or you can use the following keys
to find a different location:
     <TAB>         Cycle visibility.
     <down> / <up>   Next/previous visible headline.
     n / p        Next/previous visible headline.
     f / b        Next/previous headline same level.
     u            One level up.
   Pressing <RET> or <left> or <right> then leads to the following
result.

Cursor         Key         Note gets inserted
position                   
on headline    <RET>       as sublevel of the heading at cursor, first or
                           last
                           depending on `org-reverse-note-order'.
               <left>/<right>as same level, before/after current heading
buffer-start   <RET>       as level 2 heading at end of file or level 1
                           at beginning
                           depending on `org-reverse-note-order'.
not on         <RET>       at cursor position, level taken from context.
headline                   

   Before inserting the text into a tree, the function ensures that the
text has a headline, i.e. a first line that starts with a `*'.  If not,
a headline is constructed from the current date and some additional
data.  If you have indented the text of the note below the headline, the
indentation will be adapted if inserting the note into the tree requires
demotion from level 1.

9.4 Refiling notes
==================

Remember is usually used to quickly capture notes and tasks into one or
a few capture lists.  When reviewing the captured data, you may want to
refile some of the entries into a different list, for example into a
project.  Cutting, finding the right location and then pasting the note
is cumbersome.  To simplify this process, you can use the following
special command:

`C-c C-w'
     Refile the entry at point.  This command offers possible locations
     for refiling the entry and lets you select one with completion.
     The item is filed below the target heading as a subitem.
     Depending on `org-reverse-note-order', it will be either the first
     of last subitem, and you can toggle the value of this variable for
     the duration of the command by using a `C-u' prefix.
     By default, all level 1 headlines in the current buffer are
     considered to be targets, but you can have more complex
     definitions across a number of files.  See the variable
     `org-refile-targets' for details.  The list of targets is compiled
     upon first use, you can update it by using a double prefix
     argument (`C-u C-u') to this command.

10 Agenda Views
***************

Due to the way Org-mode works, TODO items, time-stamped items, and
tagged headlines can be scattered throughout a file or even a number of
files.  To get an overview over open action items, or over events that
are important for a particular date, this information must be collected,
sorted and displayed in an organized way.

   Org-mode can select items based on various criteria, and display them
in a separate buffer.  Six different view types are provided:

   * an _agenda_ that is like a calendar and shows information for
     specific dates,

   * a _TODO list_ that covers all unfinished action items,

   * a _tags view_, showings headlines based on the tags associated
     with them,

   * a _timeline view_ that shows all events in a single Org-mode file,
     in time-sorted view,

   * a _stuck projects view_ showing projects that currently don't move
     along, and

   * _custom views_ that are special tag/keyword searches and
     combinations of different views.

The extracted information is displayed in a special _agenda buffer_.
This buffer is read-only, but provides commands to visit the
corresponding locations in the original Org-mode files, and even to
edit these files remotely.

   Two variables control how the agenda buffer is displayed and whether
the window configuration is restored when the agenda exits:
`org-agenda-window-setup' and `org-agenda-restore-windows-after-quit'.

* Menu:

* Agenda files::                Files being searched for agenda information
* Agenda dispatcher::           Keyboard access to agenda views
* Built-in agenda views::       What is available out of the box?

File: org,  Node: Agenda files,  Next: Agenda dispatcher,  Prev: Agenda views,  Up: Agenda views

10.1 Agenda files
=================

The information to be shown is normally collected from all _agenda
files_, the files listed in the variable `org-agenda-files'(1). If a
directory is part of this list, all files with the extension `.org' in
this directory will be part of the list.

   Thus even if you only work with a single Org-mode file, this file
should be put into that list(2).  You can customize `org-agenda-files',
but the easiest way to maintain it is through the following commands

`C-c ['
     Add current file to the list of agenda files.  The file is added to
     the front of the list.  If it was already in the list, it is moved
     to the front.  With prefix arg, file is added/moved to the end.  

`C-c ]'
     Remove current file from the list of agenda files.  

`C-,'
`C-''
     Cycle through agenda file list, visiting one file after the other.

The Org menu contains the current list of files and can be used to
visit any of them.

   If you would like to focus the agenda temporarily onto a file not in
this list, or onto just one file in the list or even only a subtree in a
file, this can be done in different ways.  For a single agenda command,
you may press `<' once or several times in the dispatcher (*note Agenda
dispatcher::).  To restrict the agenda scope for an extended period,
use the following commands:

`C-c C-x <'
     Permanently restrict the agenda to the current subtree.  When with
     a prefix argument, or with the cursor before the first headline in
     a file, the agenda scope is set to the entire file.  This
     restriction remains in effect until removed with `C-c C-x >', or
     by typing either `<' or `>' in the agenda dispatcher.  If there is
     a window displaying an agenda view, the new restriction takes
     effect immediately.  

`C-c C-x <'
     Remove the permanent restriction created by `C-c C-x <'.

When working with `Speedbar', you can use the following commands in the
speedbar frame:
`< in the speedbar frame'
     Permanently restrict the agenda to the item at the cursor in the
     speedbar frame, either an Org-mode file or a subtree in such a
     file.  If there is a window displaying an agenda view, the new
     restriction takes effect immediately.  

`> in the speedbar frame'
     Lift the restriction again.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) If the value of that variable is not a list, but a single file
name, then the list of agenda files will be maintained in that external
file.

   (2) When using the dispatcher, pressing `<' before selecting a
command will actually limit the command to the current file, and ignore
`org-agenda-files' until the next dispatcher command.


File: org,  Node: Agenda dispatcher,  Next: Built-in agenda views,  Prev: Agenda files,  Up: Agenda views

10.2 The agenda dispatcher
==========================

The views are created through a dispatcher that should be bound to a
global key, for example `C-c a' (*note Installation::).  In the
following we will assume that `C-c a' is indeed how the dispatcher is
accessed and list keyboard access to commands accordingly.  After
pressing `C-c a', an additional letter is required to execute a
command.  The dispatcher offers the following default commands:
`a'
     Create the calendar-like agenda (*note Weekly/Daily agenda::).

`t / T'
     Create a list of all TODO items (*note Global TODO list::).

`m / M'
     Create a list of headlines matching a TAGS expression (*note
     Matching tags and properties::).

`L'
     Create the timeline view for the current buffer (*note Timeline::).

`# / !'
     Create a list of stuck projects (*note Stuck projects::).

`/'
     Search for a regular expression in all agenda files and
     additionally in the files listed in
     `org-agenda-multi-occur-extra-files'.  This uses the Emacs command
     `multi-occur'.  A prefix argument can be used to specify the
     number of context lines for each match, default is 1.

`<'
     Restrict an agenda command to the current buffer(1).  After
     pressing `<', you still need to press the character selecting the
     command.

`< <'
     If there is an active region, restrict the following agenda
     command to the region.  Otherwise, restrict it to the current
     subtree(2).  After pressing `< <', you still need to press the
     character selecting the command.

   You can also define custom commands that will be accessible through
the dispatcher, just like the default commands.  This includes the
possibility to create extended agenda buffers that contain several
blocks together, for example the weekly agenda, the global TODO list and
a number of special tags matches.  *Note Custom agenda views::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For backward compatibility, you can also press `1' to restrict
to the current buffer.

   (2) For backward compatibility, you can also press `0' to restrict
to the current buffer.

10.3 The built-in agenda views
==============================

In this section we describe the built-in views.

* Menu:

* Weekly/Daily agenda::         The calendar page with current tasks

File: org,  Node: Weekly/Daily agenda,  Next: Global TODO list,  Prev: Built-in agenda views,  Up: Built-in agenda views

10.3.1 The weekly/daily agenda
------------------------------

The purpose of the weekly/daily _agenda_ is to act like a page of a
paper agenda, showing all the tasks for the current week or day.

`C-c a a'
     Compile an agenda for the current week from a list of org files.
     The agenda shows the entries for each day.  With a numeric
     prefix(1)  (like `C-u 2 1 C-c a a') you may set the number of days
     to be displayed (see also the variable `org-agenda-ndays')

   Remote editing from the agenda buffer means, for example, that you
can change the dates of deadlines and appointments from the agenda
buffer.  The commands available in the Agenda buffer are listed in
*Note Agenda commands::.

Calendar/Diary integration
..........................

Emacs contains the calendar and diary by Edward M. Reingold.  The
calendar displays a three-month calendar with holidays from different
countries and cultures.  The diary allows you to keep track of
anniversaries, lunar phases, sunrise/set, recurrent appointments
(weekly, monthly) and more.  In this way, it is quite complementary to
Org-mode.  It can be very useful to combine output from Org-mode with
the diary.

   In order to include entries from the Emacs diary into Org-mode's
agenda, you only need to customize the variable

     (setq org-agenda-include-diary t)

After that, everything will happen automatically.  All diary entries
including holidays, anniversaries etc will be included in the agenda
buffer created by Org-mode.  <SPC>, <TAB>, and <RET> can be used from
the agenda buffer to jump to the diary file in order to edit existing
diary entries.  The `i' command to insert new entries for the current
date works in the agenda buffer, as well as the commands `S', `M', and
`C' to display Sunrise/Sunset times, show lunar phases and to convert
to other calendars, respectively.  `c' can be used to switch back and
forth between calendar and agenda.

   If you are using the diary only for sexp entries and holidays, it is
faster to not use the above setting, but instead to copy or even move
the entries into an Org-mode file. Org-mode evaluates diary-style sexp
entries, and does it faster because there is no overhead for first
creating the diary display.  Note that the sexp entries must start at
the left margin, no white space is allowed before them.  For example,
the following segment of an Org-mode file will be processed and entries
will be made in the agenda:

     * Birthdays and similar stuff
     #+CATEGORY: Holiday
     %%(org-calendar-holiday)   ; special function for holiday names
     #+CATEGORY: Ann
     %%(diary-anniversary 14  5 1956) Arthur Dent is %d years old
     %%(diary-anniversary  2 10 1869) Mahatma Gandhi would be %d years old

Appointment reminders
.....................

Org can interact with Emacs appointments notification facility.

   To add all the appointments of your agenda files, use the command
`org-agenda-to-appt'.  This commands also lets you filter through the
list of your appointments and add only those belonging to a specific
category or matching a regular expression. See the docstring for
details.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For backward compatibility, the universal prefix `C-u' causes
all TODO entries to be listed before the agenda.  This feature is
deprecated, use the dedicated TODO list, or a block agenda instead.


File: org,  Node: Global TODO list,  Next: Matching tags and properties,  Prev: Weekly/Daily agenda,  Up: Built-in agenda views

10.3.2 The global TODO list
---------------------------

The global TODO list contains all unfinished TODO items, formatted and
collected into a single place.

`C-c a t'
     Show the global TODO list.  This collects the TODO items from all
     agenda files (*note Agenda views::) into a single buffer.  The
     buffer is in `agenda-mode', so there are commands to examine and
     manipulate the TODO entries directly from that buffer (*note
     Agenda commands::).  

`C-c a T'
     Like the above, but allows selection of a specific TODO keyword.
     You can also do this by specifying a prefix argument to `C-c a t'.
     With a `C-u' prefix you are prompted for a keyword, and you may
     also specify several keywords by separating them with `|' as
     boolean OR operator.  With a numeric prefix, the Nth keyword in
     `org-todo-keywords' is selected.  The `r' key in the agenda buffer
     regenerates it, and you can give a prefix argument to this command
     to change the selected TODO keyword, for example `3 r'.  If you
     often need a search for a specific keyword, define a custom
     command for it (*note Agenda dispatcher::).
     Matching specific TODO keywords can also be done as part of a tags
     search (*note Tag searches::).

   Remote editing of TODO items means that you can change the state of a
TODO entry with a single key press.  The commands available in the TODO
list are described in *Note Agenda commands::.

   Normally the global todo list simply shows all headlines with TODO
keywords.  This list can become very long.  There are two ways to keep
it more compact:
   - Some people view a TODO item that has been _scheduled_ for
     execution (*note Time stamps::) as no longer _open_.  Configure the
     variable `org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled' to exclude scheduled
     items from the global TODO list.

   - TODO items may have sublevels to break up the task into subtasks.
     In such cases it may be enough to list only the highest level TODO
     headline and omit the sublevels from the global list.  Configure
     the variable `org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels' to get this behavior.


File: org,  Node: Matching tags and properties,  Next: Timeline,  Prev: Global TODO list,  Up: Built-in agenda views

10.3.3 Matching Tags and Properties
-----------------------------------

If headlines in the agenda files are marked with _tags_ (*note Tags::),
you can select headlines based on the tags that apply to them and
collect them into an agenda buffer.

`C-c a m'
     Produce a list of all headlines that match a given set of tags.
     The command prompts for a selection criterion, which is a boolean
     logic expression with tags, like `+work+urgent-withboss' or
     `work|home' (*note Tags::).  If you often need a specific search,
     define a custom command for it (*note Agenda dispatcher::).  

`C-c a M'
     Like `C-c a m', but only select headlines that are also TODO items
     and force checking subitems (see variable
     `org-tags-match-list-sublevels').  Matching specific todo keywords
     together with a tags match is also possible, see *Note Tag
     searches::.

   The commands available in the tags list are described in *Note
Agenda commands::.


File: org,  Node: Timeline,  Next: Stuck projects,  Prev: Matching tags and properties,  Up: Built-in agenda views

10.3.4 Timeline for a single file
---------------------------------

The timeline summarizes all time-stamped items from a single Org-mode
file in a _time-sorted view_.  The main purpose of this command is to
give an overview over events in a project.

`C-c a L'
     Show a time-sorted view of the org file, with all time-stamped
     items.  When called with a `C-u' prefix, all unfinished TODO
     entries (scheduled or not) are also listed under the current date.

The commands available in the timeline buffer are listed in *Note
Agenda commands::.


File: org,  Node: Stuck projects,  Prev: Timeline,  Up: Built-in agenda views

10.3.5 Stuck projects
---------------------

If you are following a system like David Allen's GTD to organize your
work, one of the "duties" you have is a regular review to make sure
that all projects move along.  A _stuck_ project is a project that has
no defined next actions, so it will never show up in the TODO lists
Org-mode produces.  During the review, you need to identify such
projects and define next actions for them.

`C-c a #'
     List projects that are stuck.  

`C-c a !'
     Customize the variable `org-stuck-projects' to define what a stuck
     project is and how to find it.

   You almost certainly will have to configure this view before it will
work for you.  The built-in default assumes that all your projects are
level-2 headlines, and that a project is not stuck if it has at least
one entry marked with a todo keyword TODO or NEXT or NEXTACTION.

   Lets assume that you, in your own way of using Org-mode, identify
projects with a tag PROJECT, and that you use a todo keyword MAYBE to
indicate a project that should not be considered yet.  Lets further
assume that the todo keyword DONE marks finished projects, and that NEXT
and TODO indicate next actions.  The tag @SHOP indicates shopping and
is a next action even without the NEXT tag.  Finally, if the project
contains the special word IGNORE anywhere, it should not be listed
either.  In this case you would start by identifying eligible projects
with a tags/todo match `+PROJECT/-MAYBE-DONE', and then check for TODO,
NEXT, @SHOP, and IGNORE in the subtree to identify projects that are
not stuck.  The correct customization for this is

     (setq org-stuck-projects
           '("+PROJECT/-MAYBE-DONE" ("NEXT" "TODO") ("@SHOP")
                                    "\\<IGNORE\\>"))

10.4 Presentation and sorting
=============================

Before displaying items in an agenda view, Org-mode visually prepares
the items and sorts them.  Each item occupies a single line.  The line
starts with a _prefix_ that contains the _category_ (*note
Categories::) of the item and other important information.  You can
customize the prefix using the option `org-agenda-prefix-format'.  The
prefix is followed by a cleaned-up version of the outline headline
associated with the item.

* Menu:

* Categories::                  Not all tasks are equal
* Time-of-day specifications::  How the agenda knows the time
* Sorting of agenda items::     The order of things


File: org,  Node: Categories,  Next: Time-of-day specifications,  Prev: Presentation and sorting,  Up: Presentation and sorting

10.4.1 Categories
-----------------

The category is a broad label assigned to each agenda item.  By default,
the category is simply derived from the file name, but you can also
specify it with a special line in the buffer, like this(1):

     #+CATEGORY: Thesis

If you would like to have a special CATEGORY for a single entry or a
(sub)tree, give the entry a `:CATEGORY:' property with the location as
the value (*note Properties and columns::).

The display in the agenda buffer looks best if the category is not
longer than 10 characters.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) For backward compatibility, the following also works: If there
are several such lines in a file, each specifies the category for the
text below it.  The first category also applies to any text before the
first CATEGORY line.  However, using this method is _strongly_
deprecated as it is incompatible with the outline structure of the
document.  The correct method for setting multiple categories in a
buffer is using a property.


File: org,  Node: Time-of-day specifications,  Next: Sorting of agenda items,  Prev: Categories,  Up: Presentation and sorting

10.4.2 Time-of-Day Specifications
---------------------------------

Org-mode checks each agenda item for a time-of-day specification.  The
time can be part of the time stamp that triggered inclusion into the
agenda, for example as in `<2005-05-10 Tue 19:00>'.  Time ranges can be
specified with two time stamps, like
`<2005-05-10 Tue 20:30>--<2005-05-10 Tue 22:15>'.

   In the headline of the entry itself, a time(range) may also appear as
plain text (like `12:45' or a `8:30-1pm'.  If the agenda integrates the
Emacs diary (*note Weekly/Daily agenda::), time specifications in diary
entries are recognized as well.

   For agenda display, Org-mode extracts the time and displays it in a
standard 24 hour format as part of the prefix.  The example times in
the previous paragraphs would end up in the agenda like this:

         8:30-13:00 Arthur Dent lies in front of the bulldozer
        12:45...... Ford Prefect arrives and takes Arthur to the pub
        19:00...... The Vogon reads his poem
        20:30-22:15 Marwin escorts the Hitchhikers to the bridge

   If the agenda is in single-day mode, or for the display of today, the
timed entries are embedded in a time grid, like

         8:00...... ------------------
         8:30-13:00 Arthur Dent lies in front of the bulldozer
        10:00...... ------------------
        12:00...... ------------------
        12:45...... Ford Prefect arrives and takes Arthur to the pub
        14:00...... ------------------
        16:00...... ------------------
        18:00...... ------------------
        19:00...... The Vogon reads his poem
        20:00...... ------------------
        20:30-22:15 Marwin escorts the Hitchhikers to the bridge

   The time grid can be turned on and off with the variable
`org-agenda-use-time-grid', and can be configured with
`org-agenda-time-grid'.


File: org,  Node: Sorting of agenda items,  Prev: Time-of-day specifications,  Up: Presentation and sorting

10.4.3 Sorting of agenda items
------------------------------

Before being inserted into a view, the items are sorted.  How this is
done depends on the type of view.
   * For the daily/weekly agenda, the items for each day are sorted.
     The default order is to first collect all items containing an
     explicit time-of-day specification.  These entries will be shown
     at the beginning of the list, as a _schedule_ for the day.  After
     that, items remain grouped in categories, in the sequence given by
     `org-agenda-files'.  Within each category, items are sorted by
     priority (*note Priorities::), which is composed of the base
     priority (2000 for priority `A', 1000 for `B', and 0 for `C'),
     plus additional increments for overdue scheduled or deadline items.

   * For the TODO list, items remain in the order of categories, but
     within each category, sorting takes place according to priority
     (*note Priorities::).

   * For tags matches, items are not sorted at all, but just appear in
     the sequence in which they are found in the agenda files.

   Sorting can be customized using the variable
`org-agenda-sorting-strategy'.

10.5 Commands in the agenda buffer
==================================

Entries in the agenda buffer are linked back to the org file or diary
file where they originate.  You are not allowed to edit the agenda
buffer itself, but commands are provided to show and jump to the
original entry location, and to edit the org-files "remotely" from the
agenda buffer.  In this way, all information is stored only once,
removing the risk that your agenda and note files may diverge.

   Some commands can be executed with mouse clicks on agenda lines.  For
the other commands, the cursor needs to be in the desired line.

`<RET>'
     Go to the original location of the item and delete other windows.  

`f'
     Toggle Follow mode.  In Follow mode, as you move the cursor through
     the agenda buffer, the other window always shows the corresponding
     location in the org file.  The initial setting for this mode in new
     agenda buffers can be set with the variable
     `org-agenda-start-with-follow-mode'.  

`b'
     Display the entire subtree of the current item in an indirect
     buffer.  With numerical prefix ARG, go up to this level and then
     take that tree.  If ARG is negative, go up that many levels.  With
     `C-u' prefix, do not remove the previously used indirect buffer.  

`l'
     Toggle Logbook mode.  In Logbook mode, entries that where marked
     DONE while logging was on (variable `org-log-done') are shown in
     the agenda, as are entries that have been clocked on that day.

Change display

`o'
     Delete other windows.  

`d w m y'
     Switch to day/week/month/year view.  When switching to day or week
     view, this setting becomes the default for subseqent agenda
     commands.  Since month and year views are slow to create, the do
     not become the default.  

`D'
     Toggle the inclusion of diary entries.  See *Note Weekly/Daily
     agenda::.  

`g'
     Toggle the time grid on and off.  See also the variables

`r'
     Recreate the agenda buffer, for example to reflect the changes
     after modification of the time stamps of items with S-<left> and
     S-<right>.  When the buffer is the global todo list, a prefix
     argument is interpreted to create a selective list for a specific
     TODO keyword.  

`s'

     Save all Org-mode buffers in the current Emacs session.  

`<right>'
     Display the following `org-agenda-ndays' days.  For example, if
     the display covers a week, switch to the following week.  With
     prefix arg, go forward that many times `org-agenda-ndays' days.

     Digit argument.  

`C-_'
     Undo a change due to a remote editing command.  The change is
     undone both in the agenda buffer and in the remote buffer.  

`t'
     Change the TODO state of the item, both in the agenda and in the
     original org file.  

`C-k'
     Delete the current agenda item along with the entire subtree
     belonging to it in the original Org-mode file.  If the text to be
     deleted remotely is longer than one line, the kill needs to be
     confirmed by the user.  See variable `org-agenda-confirm-kill'.  

`$'
     Archive the subtree corresponding to the current headline.  

`T'
     Show all tags associated with the current item.  Because of
     inheritance, this may be more than the tags listed in the line
     itself.  

`:'
     Set tags for the current headline.  If there is an active region
     in the agenda, change a tag for all headings in the region.  

`a'
     Toggle the ARCHIVE tag for the current headline.  

`,'
     Set the priority for the current item.  Org-mode prompts for the
     priority character. If you reply with <SPC>, the priority cookie
     is removed from the entry.  

`P'
     Display weighted priority of current item.  

`+'
`S-<up>'
     Increase the priority of the current item.  The priority is
     changed in the original buffer, but the agenda is not resorted.
     Use the `r' key for this.  

`-'
`S-<down>'
     Decrease the priority of the current item.  

`C-c C-s'
     Schedule this item 

`C-c C-d'
     Set a deadline for this item.  

`S-<right>'
     Change the time stamp associated with the current line by one day
     into the future.  With prefix argument, change it by that many
     days.  For example, `3 6 5 S-<right>' will change it by a year.
     The stamp is changed in the original org file, but the change is
     not directly reflected in the agenda buffer.  Use the `r' key to
     update the buffer.  

`S-<left>'
     Change the time stamp associated with the current line by one day
     into the past.  

`>'
     Change the time stamp associated with the current line to today.
     The key `>' has been chosen, because it is the same as `S-.' on my
     keyboard.  

`I'
     Start the clock on the current item.  If a clock is running
     already, it is stopped first.  

`O'
     Stop the previously started clock.  

`X'
     Cancel the currently running clock.

`J'
     Jump to the running clock in another window.

Calendar commands
.................

`c'
     Open the Emacs calendar and move to the date at the agenda cursor.

`c'
     When in the calendar, compute and show the Org-mode agenda for the
     date at the cursor.  

`i'
     Insert a new entry into the diary.  Prompts for the type of entry
     (day, weekly, monthly, yearly, anniversary, cyclic) and creates a
     new entry in the diary, just as `i d' etc. would do in the
     calendar.  The date is taken from the cursor position.  

`M'
     Show the phases of the moon for the three months around current
     date.  

`S'
     Show sunrise and sunset times.  The geographical location must be
     set with calendar variables, see documentation of the Emacs
     calendar.  

`C'
     Convert the date at cursor into many other cultural and historic
     calendars.  

`H'
     Show holidays for three month around the cursor date.  

`C-c C-x C-c'
     Export a single iCalendar file containing entries from all agenda
     files.

Exporting to a file
...................

`C-x C-w'
     Write the agenda view to a file.  Depending on the extension of the
     selected file name, the view will be exported as HTML (extension
     `.html' or `.htm'), Postscript (extension `.ps'), or plain text
     (any other extension).  Use the variable
     `org-agenda-exporter-settings' to set options for `ps-print' and
     for `htmlize' to be used during export.

Quit and Exit
.............

`q'
     Quit agenda, remove the agenda buffer.  

`x'
     Exit agenda, remove the agenda buffer and all buffers loaded by
     Emacs for the compilation of the agenda.  Buffers created by the
     user to visit org files will not be removed.

10.6 Custom agenda views
========================

Custom agenda commands serve two purposes: to store and quickly access
frequently used TODO and tags searches, and to create special composite
agenda buffers.  Custom agenda commands will be accessible through the
dispatcher (*note Agenda dispatcher::), just like the default commands.

* Menu:

* Storing searches::            Type once, use often
* Block agenda::                All the stuff you need in a single buffer
* Setting Options::             Changing the rules
* Exporting Agenda Views::      Writing agendas to files.
* Extracting Agenda Information for other programs::


File: org,  Node: Storing searches,  Next: Block agenda,  Prev: Custom agenda views,  Up: Custom agenda views

10.6.1 Storing searches
-----------------------

The first application of custom searches is the definition of keyboard
shortcuts for frequently used searches, either creating an agenda
buffer, or a sparse tree (the latter covering of course only the current
buffer).  Custom commands are configured in the variable
`org-agenda-custom-commands'.  You can customize this variable, for
example by pressing `C-c a C'.  You can also directly set it with Emacs
Lisp in `.emacs'.  The following example contains all valid search
types:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("w" todo "WAITING")
             ("W" todo-tree "WAITING")
             ("u" tags "+BOSS-URGENT")
             ("v" tags-todo "+BOSS-URGENT")
             ("U" tags-tree "+BOSS-URGENT")
             ("f" occur-tree "\\<FIXME\\>")
             ("h" . "HOME+Name tags searches") ; description for "h" prefix
             ("hl" tags "+HOME+Lisa")
             ("hp" tags "+HOME+Peter")
             ("hk" tags "+HOME+Kim")))

The initial string in each entry defines the keys you have to press
after the dispatcher command `C-c a' in order to access the command.
Usually this will be just a single character, but if you have many
similar commands, you can also define two-letter combinations where the
first character is the same in several combinations and serves as a
prefix key(1).  The second parameter is the search type, followed by
the string or regular expression to be used for the matching.  The
example above will therefore define:

`C-c a w'
     as a global search for TODO entries with `WAITING' as the TODO
     keyword

`C-c a W'
     as the same search, but only in the current buffer and displaying
     the results as a sparse tree

`C-c a u'
     as a global tags search for headlines marked `:BOSS:' but not
     `:URGENT:'

`C-c a v'
     as the same search as `C-c a u', but limiting the search to
     headlines that are also TODO items

`C-c a U'
     as the same search as `C-c a u', but only in the current buffer and
     displaying the result as a sparse tree

`C-c a f'
     to create a sparse tree (again: current buffer only) with all
     entries containing the word `FIXME'

`C-c a h'
     as a prefix command for a HOME tags search where you have to press
     an additional key (`l', `p' or `k') to select a name (Lisa, Peter,
     or Kim) as additional tag to match.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You can provide a description for a prefix key by inserting a
cons cell with the prefix and the description.


File: org,  Node: Block agenda,  Next: Setting Options,  Prev: Storing searches,  Up: Custom agenda views

10.6.2 Block agenda
-------------------

Another possibility is the construction of agenda views that comprise
the results of _several_ commands, each of which creates a block in the
agenda buffer.  The available commands include `agenda' for the daily
or weekly agenda (as created with `C-c a a'), `alltodo' for the global
todo list (as constructed with `C-c a t'), and the matching commands
discussed above: `todo', `tags', and `tags-todo'.  Here are two
examples:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
              ((agenda)
               (tags-todo "HOME")
               (tags "GARDEN")))
             ("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
              ((agenda)
               (tags-todo "WORK")
               (tags "OFFICE")))))

This will define `C-c a h' to create a multi-block view for stuff you
need to attend to at home.  The resulting agenda buffer will contain
your agenda for the current week, all TODO items that carry the tag
`HOME', and also all lines tagged with `GARDEN'.  Finally the command
`C-c a o' provides a similar view for office tasks.


File: org,  Node: Setting Options,  Next: Exporting Agenda Views,  Prev: Block agenda,  Up: Custom agenda views

10.6.3 Setting Options for custom commands
------------------------------------------

Org-mode contains a number of variables regulating agenda construction
and display.  The global variables define the behavior for all agenda
commands, including the custom commands.  However, if you want to change
some settings just for a single custom view, you can do so.  Setting
options requires inserting a list of variable names and values at the
right spot in `org-agenda-custom-commands'.  For example:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("w" todo "WAITING"
              ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-down))
               (org-agenda-prefix-format "  Mixed: ")))
             ("U" tags-tree "+BOSS-URGENT"
              ((org-show-following-heading nil)
               (org-show-hierarchy-above nil)))))

Now the `C-c a w' command will sort the collected entries only by
priority, and the prefix format is modified to just say `  Mixed:'
instead of giving the category of the entry.  The sparse tags tree of
`C-c a U' will now turn out ultra-compact, because neither the headline
hierarchy above the match, nor the headline following the match will be
shown.

   For command sets creating a block agenda,
`org-agenda-custom-commands' has two separate spots for setting
options.  You can add options that should be valid for just a single
command in the set, and options that should be valid for all commands in
the set.  The former are just added to the command entry, the latter
must come after the list of command entries.  Going back to the block
agenda example (*note Block agenda::), let's change the sorting strategy
for the `C-c a h' commands to `priority-down', but let's sort the
results for GARDEN tags query in the opposite order, `priority-up'.
This would look like this:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
              ((agenda)
               (tags-todo "HOME")
               (tags "GARDEN"
                     ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-up)))))
              ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-down))))
             ("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
              ((agenda)
               (tags-todo "WORK")
               (tags "OFFICE")))))

   As you see, the values and parenthesis setting is a little complex.
When in doubt, use the customize interface to set this variable - it
fully supports its structure.  Just one caveat: When setting options in
this interface, the _values_ are just lisp expressions.  So if the
value is a string, you need to add the double quotes around the value
yourself.


File: org,  Node: Exporting Agenda Views,  Next: Extracting Agenda Information for other programs,  Prev: Setting Options,  Up: Custom agenda views

10.6.4 Exporting Agenda Views
-----------------------------

If you are away from your computer, it can be very useful to have a
printed version of some agenda views to carry around.  Org-mode can
export custom agenda views as plain text, HTML(1) and postscript.  If
you want to do this only occasionally, use the command

`C-x C-w'
     Write the agenda view to a file.  Depending on the extension of the
     selected file name, the view will be exported as HTML (extension
     `.html' or `.htm'), Postscript (extension `.ps'), or plain text
     (any other extension).  Use the variable
     `org-agenda-exporter-settings' to set options for `ps-print' and
     for `htmlize' to be used during export, for example
          (setq org-agenda-exporter-settings
                '((ps-number-of-columns 2)
                  (ps-landscape-mode t)
                  (htmlize-output-type 'css)))

   If you need to export certain agenda views frequently, you can
associate any custom agenda command with a list of output file names
(2).  Here is an example that first does define custom commands for the
agenda and the global todo list, together with a number of files to
which to export them.  Then we define two block agenda commands and
specify filenames for them as well.  File names can be relative to the
current working directory, or absolute.

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("X" agenda "" nil ("agenda.html" "agenda.ps"))
             ("Y" alltodo "" nil ("todo.html" "todo.txt" "todo.ps"))
             ("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
              ((agenda)
               (tags-todo "HOME")
               (tags "GARDEN"))
              nil
              ("~/views/home.html"))
             ("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
              ((agenda)
               (tags-todo "WORK")
               (tags "OFFICE"))
              nil
              ("~/views/office.ps"))))

   The extension of the file name determines the type of export.  If it
is `.html', Org-mode will use the `htmlize.el' package to convert the
buffer to HTML and save it to this file name.  If the extension is
`.ps', `ps-print-buffer-with-faces' is used to produce postscript
output.  Any other extension produces a plain ASCII file.

   The export files are _not_ created when you use one of those
commands interactively.  Instead, there is a special command to produce
_all_ specified files in one step:

`C-c a e'
     Export all agenda views that have export filenames associated with
     them.

   You can use the options section of the custom agenda commands to also
set options for the export commands.  For example:

     (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
           '(("X" agenda ""
              ((ps-number-of-columns 2)
               (ps-landscape-mode t)
               (org-agenda-prefix-format " [ ] ")
               (org-agenda-with-colors nil)
               (org-agenda-remove-tags t))
              ("theagenda.ps"))))

This command sets two options for the postscript exporter, to make it
print in two columns in landscape format - the resulting page can be cut
in two and then used in a paper agenda.  The remaining settings modify
the agenda prefix to omit category and scheduling information, and
instead include a checkbox to check off items.  We also remove the tags
to make the lines compact, and we don't want to use colors for the
black-and-white printer.  Settings specified in
`org-agenda-exporter-settings' will also apply, but the settings in
`org-agenda-custom-commands' take precedence.

From the command line you may also use
     emacs -f org-batch-store-agenda-views -kill
   or, if you need to modify some parameters
     emacs -eval '(org-batch-store-agenda-views                      \
                   org-agenda-ndays 30                               \
                   org-agenda-start-day "2007-11-01"                 \
                   org-agenda-include-diary nil                      \
                   org-agenda-files (quote ("~/org/project.org")))'  \
           -kill
   which will create the agenda views restricted to the file
`~/org/project.org', without diary entries and with 30 days extent.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You need to install Hrvoje Niksic' `htmlize.el'.

   (2) If you want to store standard views like the weekly agenda or
the global TODO list as well, you need to define custom commands for
them in order to be able to specify filenames.


File: org,  Node: Extracting Agenda Information for other programs,  Prev: Exporting Agenda Views,  Up: Custom agenda views

10.6.5 Extracting Agenda Information for other programs
-------------------------------------------------------

Org-mode provides commands to access agenda information for the command
line in emacs batch mode.  This extracted information can be sent
directly to a printer, or it can be read by a program that does further
processing of the data.  The first of these commands is the function
`org-batch-agenda', that produces an agenda view and sends it as ASCII
text to STDOUT.  The command takes a single string as parameter.  If
the string has length 1, it is used as a key to one of the commands you
have configured in `org-agenda-custom-commands', basically any key you
can use after `C-c a'.  For example, to directly print the current TODO
list, you could use

     emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -eval '(org-batch-agenda "t")' | lpr

   If the parameter is a string with 2 or more characters, it is used
as a tags/todo match string.  For example, to print your local shopping
list (all items with the tag `shop', but excluding the tag `NewYork'),
you could use

     emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs                                      \
           -eval '(org-batch-agenda "+shop-NewYork")' | lpr

You may also modify parameters on the fly like this:

     emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs                                      \
        -eval '(org-batch-agenda "a"                               \
                 org-agenda-ndays 30                               \
                 org-agenda-include-diary nil                      \
                 org-agenda-files (quote ("~/org/project.org")))'  \
        | lpr

which will produce a 30 day agenda, fully restricted to the Org file
`~/org/projects.org', not even including the diary.

   If you want to process the agenda data in more sophisticated ways,
you can use the command `org-batch-agenda-csv' to get a comma-separated
list of values for each agenda item.  Each line in the output will
contain a number of fields separated by commas.  The fields in a line
are:

     category     The category of the item
     head         The headline, without TODO kwd, TAGS and PRIORITY
     type         The type of the agenda entry, can be
                     todo               selected in TODO match
                     tagsmatch          selected in tags match
                     diary              imported from diary
                     deadline           a deadline
                     scheduled          scheduled
                     timestamp          appointment, selected by timestamp
                     closed             entry was closed on date
                     upcoming-deadline  warning about nearing deadline
                     past-scheduled     forwarded scheduled item
                     block              entry has date block including date
     todo         The todo keyword, if any
     tags         All tags including inherited ones, separated by colons
     date         The relevant date, like 2007-2-14
     time         The time, like 15:00-16:50
     extra        String with extra planning info
     priority-l   The priority letter if any was given
     priority-n   The computed numerical priority

Time and date will only be given if a timestamp (or deadline/scheduled)
lead to the selection of the item.

   A CSV list like this is very easy to use in a post processing script.
For example, here is a Perl program that gets the TODO list from
Emacs/org-mode and prints all the items, preceded by a checkbox:

     #!/usr/bin/perl

     # define the Emacs command to run
     $cmd = "emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -eval '(org-batch-agenda-csv \"t\")'";

     # run it and capture the output
     $agenda = qx{$cmd 2>/dev/null};

     # loop over all lines
     foreach $line (split(/\n/,$agenda)) {

       # get the individual values
       ($category,$head,$type,$todo,$tags,$date,$time,$extra,
        $priority_l,$priority_n) = split(/,/,$line);

       # proccess and print
       print "[ ] $head\n";
     }

11 Embedded LaTeX
*****************

Plain ASCII is normally sufficient for almost all note taking.  One
exception, however, are scientific notes which need to be able to
contain mathematical symbols and the occasional formula.  LaTeX(1) is
widely used to typeset scientific documents. Org-mode supports
embedding LaTeX code into its files, because many academics are used to
read LaTeX source code, and because it can be readily processed into
images for HTML production.

   It is not necessary to mark LaTeX macros and code in any special way.
If you observe a few conventions, Org-mode knows how to find it and what
to do with it.

* Menu:

* Math symbols::                TeX macros for symbols and Greek letters
* Subscripts and Superscripts::  Simple syntax for raising/lowering text
* LaTeX fragments::             Complex formulas made easy

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) LaTeX is a macro system based on Donald E. Knuth's TeX system.
Many of the features described here as "LaTeX" are really from TeX, but
for simplicity I am blurring this distinction.


File: org,  Node: Math symbols,  Next: Subscripts and Superscripts,  Prev: Embedded LaTeX,  Up: Embedded LaTeX

11.1 Math symbols
=================

You can use LaTeX macros to insert special symbols like `\alpha' to
indicate the Greek letter, or `\to' to indicate an arrow.  Completion
for these macros is available, just type `\' and maybe a few letters,
and press `M-<TAB>' to see possible completions.  Unlike LaTeX code,
Org-mode allows these macros to be present without surrounding math
delimiters, for example:

     Angles are written as Greek letters \alpha, \beta and \gamma.

   During HTML export (*note HTML export::), these symbols are
translated into the proper syntax for HTML, for the above examples this
is `&alpha;' and `&rarr;', respectively.


File: org,  Node: Subscripts and Superscripts,  Next: LaTeX fragments,  Prev: Math symbols,  Up: Embedded LaTeX

11.2 Subscripts and Superscripts
================================

Just like in LaTeX, `^' and `_' are used to indicate super- and
subscripts.  Again, these can be used without embedding them in
math-mode delimiters.  To increase the readability of ASCII text, it is
not necessary (but OK) to surround multi-character sub- and superscripts
with curly braces.  For example

     The mass if the sun is M_sun = 1.989 x 10^30 kg.  The radius of
     the sun is R_{sun} = 6.96 x 10^8 m.

   To avoid interpretation as raised or lowered text, you can quote `^'
and `_' with a backslash: `\_' and `\^'.

   During HTML export (*note HTML export::), subscript and superscripts
are surrounded with `<sub>' and `<sup>' tags, respectively.

11.3 LaTeX fragments
====================

With symbols, sub- and superscripts, HTML is pretty much at its end when
it comes to representing mathematical formulas(1). More complex
expressions need a dedicated formula processor. To this end, Org-mode
can contain arbitrary LaTeX fragments. It provides commands to preview
the typeset result of these fragments, and upon export to HTML, all
fragments will be converted to images and inlined into the HTML
document(2). For this to work you need to be on a system with a working
LaTeX installation. You also need the `dvipng' program, available at
`http://sourceforge.net/projects/dvipng/'. The LaTeX header that will
be used when processing a fragment can be configured with the variable
`org-format-latex-header'.

   LaTeX fragments don't need any special marking at all.  The following
snippets will be identified as LaTeX source code:
   * Environments of any kind.  The only requirement is that the
     `\begin' statement appears on a new line, preceded by only
     whitespace.

   * Text within the usual LaTeX math delimiters.  To avoid conflicts
     with currency specifications, single `$' characters are only
     recognized as math delimiters if the enclosed text contains at
     most two line breaks, is directly attached to the `$' characters
     with no whitespace in between, and if the closing `$' is followed
     by whitespace or punctuation.  For the other delimiters, there is
     no such restriction, so when in doubt, use `\(...\)' as inline
     math delimiters.

For example:

     \begin{equation}                          % arbitrary environments,
     x=\sqrt{b}                                % even tables, figures
     \end{equation}                            % etc

     If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be
     either $$ a=+\sqrt{2} $$ or \[ a=-\sqrt{2} \].

If you need any of the delimiter ASCII sequences for other purposes, you
can configure the option `org-format-latex-options' to deselect the
ones you do not wish to have interpreted by the LaTeX converter.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Yes, there is MathML, but that is not yet fully supported by
many browsers, and there is no decent converter for turning LaTeX or
ASCII representations of formulas into MathML. So for the time being,
converting formulas into images seems the way to go.

   (2) The LaTeX export will not use images for displaying LaTeX
fragments but include these fragments directly into the LaTeX code.

11.4 Processing LaTeX fragments
===============================

LaTeX fragments can be processed to produce a preview images of the
typeset expressions:

`C-c C-x C-l'
     Produce a preview image of the LaTeX fragment at point and overlay
     it over the source code.  If there is no fragment at point,
     process all fragments in the current entry (between two
     headlines).  When called with a prefix argument, process the
     entire subtree.  When called with two prefix arguments, or when
     the cursor is before the first headline, process the entire buffer.  

`C-c C-c'
     Remove the overlay preview images.

   During HTML export (*note HTML export::), all LaTeX fragments are
converted into images and inlined into the document if the following
setting is active:

     (setq org-export-with-LaTeX-fragments t)


File: org,  Node: CDLaTeX mode,  Prev: Processing LaTeX fragments,  Up: Embedded LaTeX

11.5 Using CDLaTeX to enter math
================================

CDLaTeX-mode is a minor mode that is normally used in combination with a
major LaTeX mode like AUCTeX in order to speed-up insertion of
environments and math templates.  Inside Org-mode, you can make use of
some of the features of cdlatex-mode.  You need to install `cdlatex.el'
and `texmathp.el' (the latter comes also with AUCTeX) from
`http://www.astro.uva.nl/~dominik/Tools/cdlatex'.  Don't turn
cdlatex-mode itself under Org-mode, but use the light version
`org-cdlatex-mode' that comes as part of Org-mode.  Turn it on for the
current buffer with `M-x org-cdlatex-mode', or for all Org-mode files
with

     (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-org-cdlatex)

   When this mode is enabled, the following features are present (for
more details see the documentation of cdlatex-mode):
   * Environment templates can be inserted with `C-c {'.

   * The <TAB> key will do template expansion if the cursor is inside a
     LaTeX fragment(1).  For example, <TAB> will expand `fr' to
     `\frac{}{}' and position the cursor correctly inside the first
     brace.  Another <TAB> will get you into the second brace.  Even
     outside fragments, <TAB> will expand environment abbreviations at
     the beginning of a line.  For example, if you write `equ' at the
     beginning of a line and press <TAB>, this abbreviation will be
     expanded to an `equation' environment.  To get a list of all
     abbreviations, type `M-x cdlatex-command-help'.

   * Pressing `_' and `^' inside a LaTeX fragment will insert these
     characters together with a pair of braces.  If you use <TAB> to
     move out of the braces, and if the braces surround only a single
     character or macro, they are removed again (depending on the
     variable `cdlatex-simplify-sub-super-scripts').

   * Pressing the backquote ``' followed by a character inserts math
     macros, also outside LaTeX fragments.  If you wait more than 1.5
     seconds after the backquote, a help window will pop up.

   * Pressing the normal quote `'' followed by another character
     modifies the symbol before point with an accent or a font.  If you
     wait more than 1.5 seconds after the backquote, a help window will
     pop up.  Character modification will work only inside LaTeX
     fragments, outside the quote is normal.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Org-mode has a method to test if the cursor is inside such a
fragment, see the documentation of the function
`org-inside-LaTeX-fragment-p'.

12 Exporting
************

Org-mode documents can be exported into a variety of other formats.  For
printing and sharing of notes, ASCII export produces a readable and
simple version of an Org-mode file.  HTML export allows you to publish a
notes file on the web, while the XOXO format provides a solid base for
exchange with a broad range of other applications. LaTeX export lets
you use Org-mode and its structured editing functions to easily create
LaTeX files.  To incorporate entries with associated times like
deadlines or appointments into a desktop calendar program like iCal,
Org-mode can also produce extracts in the iCalendar format.  Currently
Org-mode only supports export, not import of these different formats.

   When exporting, Org-mode uses special conventions to enrich the
output produced.  *Note Text interpretation::, for more details.

`C-c C-e'

     help-window listing the additional key(s) needed to launch an

12.1 ASCII export
=================

ASCII export produces a simple and very readable version of an Org-mode
file.

`C-c C-e a'
     Export as ASCII file.  For an org file `myfile.org', the ASCII file
     will be `myfile.txt'.  The file will be overwritten without
     warning.  If there is an active region, only the region will be
     exported. If the selected region is a single tree, the tree head
     will become the document title.  If the tree head entry has or
     inherits an EXPORT_FILE_NAME property, that name will be used for
     the export.  

`C-c C-e v a'
     Export only the visible part of the document.

   In the exported version, the first 3 outline levels will become
headlines, defining a general document structure.  Additional levels
will be exported as itemized lists.  If you want that transition to
occur at a different level, specify it with a prefix argument.  For
example,

     C-1 C-c C-e a

creates only top level headlines and does the rest as items.  When
headlines are converted to items, the indentation of the text following
the headline is changed to fit nicely under the item.  This is done with
the assumption that the first bodyline indicates the base indentation of
the body text.  Any indentation larger than this is adjusted to preserve
the layout relative to the first line.  Should there be lines with less
indentation than the first, these are left alone.

12.2.1 HTML export commands
---------------------------

`C-c C-e h'
     Export as HTML file `myfile.html'.  For an org file `myfile.org',
     the ASCII file will be `myfile.html'.  The file will be
     overwritten without warning.  If there is an active region, only
     the region will be exported. If the selected region is a single
     tree, the tree head will become the document title.  If the tree
     head entry has or inherits an EXPORT_FILE_NAME property, that name
     will be used for the export.  

`C-c C-e b'
     Export as HTML file and immediately open it with a browser.  

`C-c C-e H'
     Export to a temporary buffer, do not create a file.  

`C-c C-e R'
     Export the active region to a temporary buffer.  With prefix arg,
     do not produce file header and foot, but just the plain HTML
     section for the region.  This is good for cut-and-paste operations.  

`C-c C-e v h'

`C-c C-e v b'

`C-c C-e v H'

`C-c C-e v R'
     Export only the visible part of the document.

`M-x org-export-region-as-html'
     Convert the region to HTML under the assumption that it was
     org-mode syntax before.  This is a global command that can be
     invoked in any buffer.

`M-x org-replace-region-by-HTML'
     Replace the active region (assumed to be in Org-mode syntax) by
     HTML code.

   In the exported version, the first 3 outline levels will become
headlines, defining a general document structure.  Additional levels
will be exported as itemized lists.  If you want that transition to
occur at a different level, specify it with a prefix argument.  For
example,

     C-2 C-c C-e b

creates two levels of headings and does the rest as items.

12.2.2 Quoting HTML tags
------------------------

Plain `<' and `>' are always transformed to `&lt;' and `&gt;' in HTML
export.  If you want to include simple HTML tags which should be
interpreted as such, mark them with `@' as in `@<b>bold text@</b>'.
Note that this really works only for simple tags.  For more extensive
HTML that should be copied verbatim to the exported file use either

     #+HTML: Literal HTML code for export

or

     #+BEGIN_HTML
     All lines between these markers are exported literally
     #+END_HTML


File: org,  Node: Links,  Next: Images,  Prev: Quoting HTML tags,  Up: HTML export

12.2.3 Links
------------

Internal links (*note Internal links::) will continue to work in HTML
files only if they match a dedicated `<<target>>'.  Automatic links
created by radio targets (*note Radio targets::) will also work in the
HTML file.  Links to external files will still work if the HTML file is
in the same directory as the Org-mode file.  Links to other `.org'
files will be translated into HTML links under the assumption that an
HTML version also exists of the linked file.  For information related to
linking files while publishing them to a publishing directory see *Note
Publishing links::.


File: org,  Node: Images,  Next: CSS support,  Prev: Links,  Up: HTML export

12.2.4 Images
-------------

HTML export can inline images given as links in the Org-mode file, and
it can make an image the clickable part of a link.  By default(1),
images are inlined if a link does not have a description.  So
`[[file:myimg.jpg]]' will be inlined, while `[[file:myimg.jpg][the
image]]' will just produce a link `the image' that points to the image.
If the description part itself is a `file:' link or a `http:' URL
pointing to an image, this image will be inlined and activated so that
clicking on the image will activate the link.  For example, to include
a thumbnail that will link to a high resolution version of the image,
you could use:

     [[file:highres.jpg][file:thumb.jpg]]

and you could use `http' addresses just as well.

File: org,  Node: CSS support,  Prev: Images,  Up: HTML export

12.2.5 CSS support
------------------

You can also give style information for the exported file.  The HTML
exporter assigns the following CSS classes to appropriate parts of the
document - your style specifications may change these:
     .todo           TODO keywords
     .done           the DONE keyword
     .timestamp      time stamp
     .timestamp-kwd  keyword associated with a time stamp, like SCHEDULED
     .tag            tag in a headline
     .target         target for links

   The default style specification can be configured through the option
`org-export-html-style'.  If you want to use a file-local style, you
may use file variables, best wrapped into a COMMENT section at the end
of the outline tree.  For example(1):

     * COMMENT html style specifications

     # Local Variables:
     # org-export-html-style: "   <style type=\"text/css\">
     #       p {font-weight: normal; color: gray; }
     #       h1 {color: black; }
     #   </style>"
     # End:

   Remember to execute `M-x normal-mode' after changing this to make
the new style visible to Emacs.  This command restarts org-mode for the
current buffer and forces Emacs to re-evaluate the local variables
section in the buffer.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Under Emacs 21, the continuation lines for a variable value
should have no `#' at the start of the line.

`C-c C-e l'
     Export as LaTeX file `myfile.tex'.  

`C-c C-e L'
     Export to a temporary buffer, do not create a file.  

`C-c C-e v l'

`C-c C-e v L'
     Export only the visible part of the document.

`M-x org-export-region-as-latex'
     Convert the region to LaTeX under the assumption that it was
     org-mode syntax before.  This is a global command that can be
     invoked in any buffer.

`M-x org-replace-region-by-latex'
     Replace the active region (assumed to be in Org-mode syntax) by
     LaTeX code.

   In the exported version, the first 3 outline levels will become
headlines, defining a general document structure.  Additional levels
will be exported as description lists.  The exporter can ignore them or
convert them to a custom string depending on `org-latex-low-levels'.

   If you want that transition to occur at a different level, specify it
with a prefix argument. For example,

     C-2 C-c C-e l

creates two levels of headings and does the rest as items.

12.3.2 Quoting LaTeX code
-------------------------

Embedded LaTeX as described in *Note Embedded LaTeX:: will be correctly
inserted into the LaTeX file.  Forthermore, you can add special code
that should only be present in LaTeX export with the following
constructs:

By default, the LaTeX output uses the class `article'.

   You can change this globally by setting a different value for
`org-export-latex-default-class' or locally by adding an option like
`#+LaTeX_CLASS: myclass' in your file.  The class should be listed in
`org-export-latex-classes', where you can also define the sectioning
structure for each class.

12.5 iCalendar export
=====================

Some people like to use Org-mode for keeping track of projects, but
still prefer a standard calendar application for anniversaries and
appointments.  In this case it can be useful to have deadlines and
other time-stamped items in Org-mode files show up in the calendar
application.  Org-mode can export calendar information in the standard
iCalendar format.  If you also want to have TODO entries included in the
export, configure the variable `org-icalendar-include-todo'.

`C-c C-e i'
     Create iCalendar entries for the current file and store them in
     the same directory, using a file extension `.ics'.  

`C-c C-e I'
     Like `C-c C-e i', but do this for all files in `org-agenda-files'.
     For each of these files, a separate iCalendar file will be
     written.  

`C-c C-e c'
     Create a single large iCalendar file from all files in
     `org-agenda-files' and write it to the file given by
     `org-combined-agenda-icalendar-file'.

   The export will honor SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION and LOCATION properties if
the selected entries have them.  If not, the summary will be derived
from the headline, and the description from the body (limited to
`org-icalendar-include-body' characters).

   How this calendar is best read and updated, depends on the
application you are using.  The FAQ covers this issue.

File: org,  Node: Initial text,  Next: Footnotes,  Prev: Comment lines,  Up: Text interpretation

12.6.2 Text before the first headline
-------------------------------------

Org-mode normally ignores any text before the first headline when
exporting, leaving this region for internal links to speed up navigation
etc.  However, in publishing-oriented files, you might want to have some
text before the first headline, like a small introduction, special HTML
code with a navigation bar, etc.  You can ask to have this part of the
file exported as well by setting the variable
`org-export-skip-text-before-1st-heading' to `nil'.  On a per-file
basis, you can get the same effect with

     #+OPTIONS: skip:nil

   The text before the first headline will be fully processed (*note
Enhancing text::), and the first non-comment line becomes the title of
the exported document.  If you need to include literal HTML, use the
special constructs described in *Note Quoting HTML tags::.  The table
of contents is normally inserted directly before the first headline of
the file.  If you would like to get it to a different location, insert
the string `[TABLE-OF-CONTENTS]' on a line by itself at the desired
location.

   Finally, if you want to use the space before the first headline for
internal purposes, but _still_ want to place something before the first
headline when exporting the file, you can use the `#+TEXT' construct:

     #+OPTIONS: skip:t
     #+TEXT: This text will go before the *first* headline.
     #+TEXT: We place the table of contents here:
     #+TEXT: [TABLE-OF-CONTENTS]
     #+TEXT: This goes between the table of contents and the first headline


File: org,  Node: Footnotes,  Next: Quoted examples,  Prev: Initial text,  Up: Text interpretation

12.6.3 Footnotes
----------------

Numbers in square brackets are treated as footnotes, so that you can use
the Emacs package `footnote.el' to create footnotes.  For example:

     The org-mode homepage[1] clearly needs help from
     a good web designer.

     [1] The link is: http://orgmode.org

Note that the `footnote' package uses `C-c !' to invoke its commands.
This binding conflicts with the org-mode command for inserting inactive
time stamps.  You could use the variable `footnote-prefix' to switch
footnotes commands to another key.  Or, if you are too used to this
binding, you could use `org-replace-disputed-keys' and
`org-disputed-keys' to change the settings in Org-mode.


File: org,  Node: Quoted examples,  Next: Enhancing text,  Prev: Footnotes,  Up: Text interpretation

12.6.4 Quoted examples
----------------------

When writing technical documents, you often need to insert examples that
are not further interpreted by Org-mode.  For historical reasons, there
are several ways to do this:

   * If a headline starts with the word `QUOTE', the text below the
     headline will be typeset as fixed-width, to allow quoting of
     computer codes etc.

   * Lines starting with `:' are also typeset in fixed-width font.
    `C-c :'
          Toggle fixed-width for entry (QUOTE) or region, see below.

   * Finally, text between
          #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
          quoted text
          #+END_EXAMPLE
     will also be exported in this way.


File: org,  Node: Enhancing text,  Next: Export options,  Prev: Quoted examples,  Up: Text interpretation

12.6.5 Enhancing text for export
--------------------------------

Some of the export backends of Org-mode allow for sophisticated text
formatting, this is true in particular for the HTML and LaTeX backends.
Org-mode has a number of typing conventions that allow to produce a
richly formatted output.

   * Plain lists `-', `*' or `+' as bullet, or with `1.' or `2)' as
     enumerator will be recognized and transformed if the backend
     supports lists.  See *Note Plain lists::.

   * You can make words *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, `=code=' and
     `~verbatim~', and, if you must, `+strikethrough+'.  Text in the
     code and verbatim string is not processed for org-mode specific
     syntax, it is exported verbatim.

   * A line consisting of only dashes, and at least 5 of them, will be
     exported as a horizontal line (`<hr/>' in HTML).

   * Many TeX macros and entire LaTeX fragments are converted into HTML
     entities or images (*note Embedded LaTeX::).

   * Tables are transformed into native tables under the exporter, if
     the export backend supports this. Data fields before the first
     horizontal separator line will be formatted as table header fields.

   * If a headline starts with the word `QUOTE', the text below the
     headline will be typeset as fixed-width, to allow quoting of
     computer codes etc.  Lines starting with `:' are also typeset in
     fixed-width font.
    `C-c :'
          Toggle fixed-width for entry (QUOTE) or region, see below.
     Finally, text between
          #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
          quoted text
          #+END_EXAMPLE
     will also be exported in this way.

   * A double backslash _at the end of a line_ enforces a line break at
     this position.

   * Strings like `\alpha' will be exported as `&alpha;', in the HTML
     output.  These strings are exported as `$\alpha$' in the LaTeX
     output.  Similarly, `\nbsp' will become `&nbsp;' in HTML and in
     LaTeX.  This applies for a long list of entities, see the variable
     `org-html-entities' for the complete list.

   If these conversions conflict with your habits of typing ASCII text,
they can all be turned off with corresponding variables.  See the
customization group `org-export-general', and the following section
which explains how to set export options with special lines in a buffer.


File: org,  Node: Export options,  Prev: Enhancing text,  Up: Text interpretation

12.6.6 Export options
---------------------

The exporter recognizes special lines in the buffer which provide
additional information.  These lines may be put anywhere in the file.
The whole set of lines can be inserted into the buffer with `C-c C-e
t'.  For individual lines, a good way to make sure the keyword is
correct is to type `#+' and then use `M-<TAB>' completion (*note
Completion::).

`C-c C-e t'
     Insert template with export options, see example below.

     #+TITLE:     the title to be shown (default is the buffer name)
     #+AUTHOR:    the author (default taken from `user-full-name')
     #+DATE:      A date, fixed, of a format string for `format-time-string'
     #+EMAIL:     his/her email address (default from `user-mail-address')
     #+LANGUAGE:  language for HTML, e.g. `en' (`org-export-default-language')
     #+TEXT:      Some descriptive text to be inserted at the beginning.
     #+TEXT:      Several lines may be given.
     #+OPTIONS:   H:2 num:t toc:t \n:nil @:t ::t |:t ^:t f:t TeX:t ...

The OPTIONS line is a compact form to specify export settings.  Here
you can: 
     H:         set the number of headline levels for export
     num:       turn on/off section-numbers
     toc:       turn on/off table of contents, or set level limit (integer)
     \n:        turn on/off linebreak-preservation
     @:         turn on/off quoted HTML tags
     ::         turn on/off fixed-width sections
     |:         turn on/off tables
     ^:         turn on/off TeX-like syntax for sub- and superscripts.  If
                you write "^:{}", `a_{b}' will be interpreted, but
                the simple `a_b' will be left as it is.
     -:         turn on/off conversion of special strings.
     f:         turn on/off foototes like this[1].
     *:         turn on/off emphasized text (bold, italic, underlined)
     TeX:       turn on/off simple TeX macros in plain text
     LaTeX:     turn on/off LaTeX fragments
     skip:      turn on/off skipping the text before the first heading
     author:    turn on/off inclusion of author name/email into exported file
     timestamp: turn on/off inclusion creation time into exported file
     d:         turn on/off inclusion of drawers

   These options take effect in both the HTML and LaTeX export, except
for `TeX' and `LaTeX', which are respectively `t' and `nil' for the
LaTeX export.

13 Publishing
*************

Org-mode includes(1) a publishing management system that allows you to
configure automatic HTML conversion of _projects_ composed of
interlinked org files.  This system is called _org-publish_.  You can
also configure org-publish to automatically upload your exported HTML
pages and related attachments, such as images and source code files, to
a web server. Org-publish turns org-mode into a web-site authoring tool.

   You can also use Org-publish to convert files into LaTeX, or even
combine HTML and LaTeX conversion so that files are available in both
formats on the server(2).

   Org-publish has been contributed to Org-mode by David O'Toole.

* Menu:

* Configuration::               Defining projects
* Sample configuration::        Example projects
* Triggering publication::      Publication commands

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) `org-publish.el' is not distributed with Emacs 21, if you are
still using Emacs 21, you need you need to download this file
separately.

   (2) Since LaTeX files on a server are not that helpful, you surely
want to perform further conversion on them - e.g. convert them to `PDF'
format.

13.1 Configuration
==================

Publishing needs significant configuration to specify files, destination
and many other properties of a project.

* Menu:

* Project alist::               The central configuration variable
* Sources and destinations::    From here to there
* Selecting files::             What files are part of the project?
* Publishing action::           Setting the function doing the publishing
* Publishing options::          Tweaking HTML export
* Publishing links::            Which links keep working after publishing?
* Project page index::          Publishing a list of project files


File: org,  Node: Project alist,  Next: Sources and destinations,  Prev: Configuration,  Up: Configuration

13.1.1 The variable `org-publish-project-alist'
-----------------------------------------------

Org-publish is configured almost entirely through setting the value of
one variable, called `org-publish-project-alist'.  Each element of the
list configures one project, and may be in one of the two following
forms:

     ("project-name"  :property value :property value ...)

     or

     ("project-name"  :components ("project-name" "project-name" ...))

   In both cases, projects are configured by specifying property values.
A project defines the set of files that will be published, as well as
the publishing configuration to use when publishing those files.  When
a project takes the second form listed above, the individual members of
the "components" property are taken to be components of the project,
which group together files requiring different publishing options. When
you publish such a "meta-project" all the components will also publish.


File: org,  Node: Sources and destinations,  Next: Selecting files,  Prev: Project alist,  Up: Configuration

13.1.2 Sources and destinations for files
-----------------------------------------

Most properties are optional, but some should always be set. In
particular, org-publish needs to know where to look for source files,
and where to put published files.

`:base-directory'      Directory containing publishing source files
`:publishing-directory'Directory (possibly remote) where output files
                       will be published.
`:preparation-function'Function called before starting publishing
                       process, for example to run `make' for updating
                       files to be published.


File: org,  Node: Selecting files,  Next: Publishing action,  Prev: Sources and destinations,  Up: Configuration

13.1.3 Selecting files
----------------------

By default, all files with extension `.org' in the base directory are
considered part of the project.  This can be modified by setting the
properties
`:base-extension'  Extension (without the dot!) of source files.  This
                   actually is a regular expression.
`:exclude'         Regular expression to match file names that should
                   not be published, even though they have been selected
                   on the basis of their extension.
`:include'         List of files to be included regardless of
                   `:base-extension' and `:exclude'.


File: org,  Node: Publishing action,  Next: Publishing options,  Prev: Selecting files,  Up: Configuration

13.1.4 Publishing Action
------------------------

Publishing means that a file is copied to the destination directory and
possibly transformed in the process.  The default transformation is to
export Org-mode files as HTML files, and this is done by the function
`org-publish-org-to-html' which calls the HTML exporter (*note HTML
export::). But you also can publish your files in LaTeX by using the
function `org-publish-org-to-latex' instead. Other files like images
only need to be copied to the publishing destination. For non-Org-mode
files, you need to specify the publishing function.

`:publishing-function' Function executing the publication of a file.
                       This may also be a list of functions, which will
                       all be called in turn.

   The function must accept two arguments: a property list containing at
least a `:publishing-directory' property, and the name of the file to
be published.  It should take the specified file, make the necessary
transformation (if any) and place the result into the destination
folder.  You can write your own publishing function, but `org-publish'
provides one for attachments (files that only need to be copied):
`org-publish-attachment'.


File: org,  Node: Publishing options,  Next: Publishing links,  Prev: Publishing action,  Up: Configuration

13.1.5 Options for the HTML/LaTeX exporters
-------------------------------------------

The property list can be used to set many export options for the HTML
and LaTeX exporters.  In most cases, these properties correspond to user
variables in Org-mode.  The table below lists these properties along
with the variable they belong to.  See the documentation string for the
respective variable for details.

`:language'            `org-export-default-language'
`:headline-levels'     `org-export-headline-levels'
`:section-numbers'     `org-export-with-section-numbers'
`:table-of-contents'   `org-export-with-toc'
`:archived-trees'      `org-export-with-archived-trees'
`:emphasize'           `org-export-with-emphasize'
`:sub-superscript'     `org-export-with-sub-superscripts'
`:special-strings'     `org-export-with-special-strings'
`:TeX-macros'          `org-export-with-TeX-macros'
`:LaTeX-fragments'     `org-export-with-LaTeX-fragments'
`:fixed-width'         `org-export-with-fixed-width'
`:timestamps'          `org-export-with-timestamps'
 .                     
`:tags'                `org-export-with-tags'
 .                     
`:tables'              `org-export-with-tables'
`:table-auto-headline' `org-export-highlight-first-table-line'
`:style'               `org-export-html-style'
`:convert-org-links'   `org-export-html-link-org-files-as-html'
`:inline-images'       `org-export-html-inline-images'
`:expand-quoted-html'  `org-export-html-expand'
`:timestamp'           `org-export-html-with-timestamp'
`:publishing-directory'`org-export-publishing-directory'
`:preamble'            `org-export-html-preamble'
`:postamble'           `org-export-html-postamble'
`:auto-preamble'       `org-export-html-auto-preamble'
`:auto-postamble'      `org-export-html-auto-postamble'
`:author'              `user-full-name'
`:email'               `user-mail-address'

   If you use several email addresses, separate them by a semi-column.

   Most of the `org-export-with-*' variables have the same effect in
both HTML and LaTeX exporters, except for `:TeX-macros' and
`:LaTeX-fragments', respectively `nil' and `t' in the LaTeX export.

   When a property is given a value in `org-publish-project-alist', its
setting overrides the value of the corresponding user variable (if any)
during publishing.  Options set within a file (*note Export options::),
however, override everything.


File: org,  Node: Publishing links,  Next: Project page index,  Prev: Publishing options,  Up: Configuration

13.1.6 Links between published files
------------------------------------

To create a link from one Org-mode file to another, you would use
something like `[[file:foo.org][The foo]]' or simply `file:foo.org.'
(*note Hyperlinks::).  Upon publishing this link becomes a link to
`foo.html'.  In this way, you can interlink the pages of your "org web"
project and the links will work as expected when you publish them to
HTML.

   You may also link to related files, such as images. Provided you are
careful with relative pathnames, and provided you have also configured
`org-publish' to upload the related files, these links will work too.
*Note Complex example:: for an example of this usage.

   Sometime an Org-mode file to be published may contain links that are
only valid in your production environment, but not in the publishing
location.  In this case, use the property

`:link-validation-function'   Function to validate links

to define a function for checking link validity.  This function must
accept two arguments, the file name and a directory relative to which
the file name is interpreted in the production environment.  If this
function returns `nil', then the HTML generator will only insert a
description into the HTML file, but no link.  One option for this
function is `org-publish-validate-link' which checks if the given file
is part of any project in `org-publish-project-alist'.


File: org,  Node: Project page index,  Prev: Publishing links,  Up: Configuration

13.1.7 Project page index
-------------------------

The following properties may be used to control publishing of an index
of files or summary page for a given project.

`:auto-index'      When non-nil, publish an index during
                   org-publish-current-project or org-publish-all.
`:index-filename'  Filename for output of index. Defaults to `index.org'
                   (which becomes `index.html').
`:index-title'     Title of index page. Defaults to name of file.
`:index-function'  Plugin function to use for generation of index.
                   Defaults to `org-publish-org-index', which generates
                   a plain list of links to all files in the project.

13.2 Sample configuration
=========================

Below we provide two example configurations.  The first one is a simple
project publishing only a set of Org-mode files.  The second example is
more complex, with a multi-component project.

File: org,  Node: Simple example,  Next: Complex example,  Prev: Sample configuration,  Up: Sample configuration

13.2.1 Example: simple publishing configuration
-----------------------------------------------

This example publishes a set of Org-mode files to the `public_html'
directory on the local machine.

     (setq org-publish-project-alist
           '(("org"
              :base-directory "~/org/"
              :publishing-directory "~/public_html"
              :section-numbers nil
              :table-of-contents nil
              :style "<link rel=stylesheet
                     href=\"../other/mystyle.css\"
                     type=\"text/css\">")))


File: org,  Node: Complex example,  Prev: Simple example,  Up: Sample configuration

13.2.2 Example: complex publishing configuration
------------------------------------------------

This more complicated example publishes an entire website, including
org files converted to HTML, image files, emacs lisp source code, and
stylesheets. The publishing-directory is remote and private files are
excluded.

   To ensure that links are preserved, care should be taken to replicate
your directory structure on the web server, and to use relative file
paths. For example, if your org files are kept in `~/org' and your
publishable images in `~/images', you'd link to an image with
     file:../images/myimage.png
   On the web server, the relative path to the image should be the
same. You can accomplish this by setting up an "images" folder in the
right place on the webserver, and publishing images to it.

     (setq org-publish-project-alist
           '(("orgfiles"
               :base-directory "~/org/"
               :base-extension "org"
               :publishing-directory "/ssh:user@host:~/html/notebook/"
               :publishing-function org-publish-org-to-html
               :exclude "PrivatePage.org"   ;; regexp
               :headline-levels 3
               :section-numbers nil
               :table-of-contents nil
               :style "<link rel=stylesheet
                       href=\"../other/mystyle.css\" type=\"text/css\">"
               :auto-preamble t
               :auto-postamble nil)

              ("images"
               :base-directory "~/images/"
               :base-extension "jpg\\|gif\\|png"
               :publishing-directory "/ssh:user@host:~/html/images/"
               :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)

              ("other"
               :base-directory "~/other/"
               :base-extension "css\\|el"
               :publishing-directory "/ssh:user@host:~/html/other/"
               :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)
              ("website" :components ("orgfiles" "images" "other"))))


File: org,  Node: Triggering publication,  Prev: Sample configuration,  Up: Publishing

13.3 Triggering publication
===========================

Once org-publish is properly configured, you can publish with the
following functions:

`C-c C-e C'
     Prompt for a specific project and publish all files that belong to
     it.

`C-c C-e P'
     Publish the project containing the current file.

`C-c C-e F'
     Publish only the current file.

`C-c C-e A'
     Publish all projects.

   Org uses timestamps to track when a file has changed. The above
functions normally only publish changed files. You can override this and
force publishing of all files by giving a prefix argument.

14.1 Completion
===============

Org-mode supports in-buffer completion.  This type of completion does
not make use of the minibuffer.  You simply type a few letters into the
buffer and use the key to complete text right there.

`M-<TAB>'
     Complete word at point
        * At the beginning of a headline, complete TODO keywords.

        * After `\', complete TeX symbols supported by the exporter.

        * After `*', complete headlines in the current buffer so that
          they can be used in search links like `[[*find this
          headline]]'.

        * After `:' in a headline, complete tags.  The list of tags is
          taken from the variable `org-tag-alist' (possibly set through
          the `#+TAGS' in-buffer option, *note Setting tags::), or it
          is created dynamically from all tags used in the current
          buffer.

        * After `:' and not in a headline, complete property keys.  The
          list of keys is constructed dynamically from all keys used in
          the current buffer.

        * After `[', complete link abbreviations (*note Link
          abbreviations::).

        * After `#+', complete the special keywords like `TYP_TODO' or
          `OPTIONS' which set file-specific options for Org-mode.  When
          the option keyword is already complete, pressing `M-<TAB>'
          again will insert example settings for this keyword.

        * In the line after `#+STARTUP: ', complete startup keywords,
          i.e. valid keys for this line.

        * Elsewhere, complete dictionary words using ispell.

14.2 Customization
==================

There are more than 180 variables that can be used to customize
Org-mode.  For the sake of compactness of the manual, I am not
describing the variables here.  A structured overview of customization
variables is available with `M-x org-customize'.  Or select `Browse Org
Group' from the `Org->Customization' menu.  Many settings can also be
activated on a per-file basis, by putting special lines into the buffer
(*note In-buffer settings::).


File: org,  Node: In-buffer settings,  Next: The very busy C-c C-c key,  Prev: Customization,  Up: Miscellaneous

14.3 Summary of in-buffer settings
==================================

Org-mode uses special lines in the buffer to define settings on a
per-file basis.  These lines start with a `#+' followed by a keyword, a
colon, and then individual words defining a setting.  Several setting
words can be in the same line, but you can also have multiple lines for
the keyword.  While these settings are described throughout the manual,
here is a summary.  After changing any of those lines in the buffer,
press `C-c C-c' with the cursor still in the line to activate the
changes immediately.  Otherwise they become effective only when the
file is visited again in a new Emacs session.

`#+ARCHIVE: %s_done::'
     This line sets the archive location for the agenda file.  It
     applies for all subsequent lines until the next `#+ARCHIVE' line,
     or the end of the file.  The first such line also applies to any
     entries before it.  The corresponding variable is
     `org-archive-location'.

`#+CATEGORY:'
     This line sets the category for the agenda file.  The category
     applies for all subsequent lines until the next `#+CATEGORY' line,
     or the end of the file.  The first such line also applies to any
     entries before it.

`#+COLUMNS: %25ITEM .....'
     Set the default format for columns view.  This format applies when
     columns view is invoked in location where no COLUMNS property
     applies.

`#+CONSTANTS: name1=value1 ...'
     Set file-local values for constants to be used in table formulas.
     This line set the local variable
     `org-table-formula-constants-local'.  The global version of this
     variable is `org-table-formula-constants'.

`#+DRAWERS: NAME1 .....'
     Set the file-local set of drawers.  The corresponding global
     variable is `org-drawers'.

`#+LINK:  linkword replace'
     These lines (several are allowed) specify link abbreviations.
     *Note Link abbreviations::.  The corresponding variable is
     `org-link-abbrev-alist'.

`#+PRIORITIES: highest lowest default'
     This line sets the limits and the default for the priorities.  All
     three must be either letters A-Z or numbers 0-9.  The highest
     priority must have a lower ASCII number that the lowest priority.

`#+PROPERTY: Property_Name Value'
     This line sets a default inheritance value for entries in the
     current buffer, most useful for specifying the allowed values of a
     property.

`#+STARTUP:'
     This line sets options to be used at startup of Org-mode, when an
     Org-mode file is being visited.  The first set of options deals
     with the initial visibility of the outline tree.  The
     corresponding variable for global default settings is
     `org-startup-folded', with a default value `t', which means
     `overview'.  
          overview   top-level headlines only
          content    all headlines
          showall    no folding at all, show everything
     Then there are options for aligning tables upon visiting a file.
     This is useful in files containing narrowed table columns.  The
     corresponding variable is `org-startup-align-all-tables', with a
     default value `nil'.  
          align      align all tables
          noalign    don't align tables on startup
     Logging TODO state changes and clock intervals (variables
     `org-log-done' and `org-log-repeat') can be configured using these
     options.  
          logging          record a timestamp when an item is marked DONE
          nologging        don't record when items are marked DONE
          lognotedone      record timestamp and a note when DONE
          lognotestate     record timestamp and a note when TODO state changes

     Here are the options for hiding leading stars in outline headings.
     The corresponding variables are `org-hide-leading-stars' and
     `org-odd-levels-only', both with a default setting `nil' (meaning
     `showstars' and `oddeven').  
          hidestars  make all but one of the stars starting a headline invisible.
          showstars  show all stars starting a headline
          odd        allow only odd outline levels (1,3,...)
          oddeven    allow all outline levels
     To turn on custom format overlays over time stamps (variables
     `org-put-time-stamp-overlays' and
     `org-time-stamp-overlay-formats'), use 
          customtime overlay custom time format
     The following options influence the table spreadsheet (variable
     `constants-unit-system').  
          constcgs   `constants.el' should use the c-g-s unit system
          constSI    `constants.el' should use the SI unit system

`#+TAGS:  TAG1(c1) TAG2(c2)'
     These lines (several such lines are allowed) specify the legal
     tags in this file, and (potentially) the corresponding _fast tag
     selection_ keys.  The corresponding variable is `org-tag-alist'.

`#+TBLFM:'
     This line contains the formulas for the table directly above the
     line.

`#+TITLE:, #+AUTHOR:, #+EMAIL:, #+LANGUAGE:, #+TEXT:, #+OPTIONS, #+DATE:'
     These lines provide settings for exporting files.  For more
     details see *Note Export options::.

`#+SEQ_TODO:   #+TYP_TODO:'
     These lines set the TODO keywords and their interpretation in the
     current file.  The corresponding variables are `org-todo-keywords'
     and `org-todo-interpretation'.

14.4 The very busy C-c C-c key
==============================

The key `C-c C-c' has many purposes in org-mode, which are all
mentioned scattered throughout this manual.  One specific function of
this key is to add _tags_ to a headline (*note Tags::).  In many other
circumstances it means something like _Hey Org-mode, look here and
update according to what you see here_.  Here is a summary of what this
means in different contexts.

   - If there are highlights in the buffer from the creation of a sparse
     tree, or from clock display, remove these highlights.

   - If the cursor is in one of the special `#+KEYWORD' lines, this
     triggers scanning the buffer for these lines and updating the
     information.

   - If the cursor is inside a table, realign the table.  This command
     works even if the automatic table editor has been turned off.

   - If the cursor is on a `#+TBLFM' line, re-apply the formulas to the
     entire table.

   - If the cursor is inside a table created by the `table.el' package,
     activate that table.

   - If the current buffer is a remember buffer, close the note and
     file it.  With a prefix argument, file it, without further
     interaction, to the default location.

   - If the cursor is on a `<<<target>>>', update radio targets and
     corresponding links in this buffer.

   - If the cursor is in a property line or at the start or end of a
     property drawer, offer property commands.

   - If the cursor is in a plain list item with a checkbox, toggle the
     status of the checkbox.

   - If the cursor is on a numbered item in a plain list, renumber the
     ordered list.

   - If the cursor is on the `#+BEGIN' line of a dynamical block, the
     block is updated.

14.5 A cleaner outline view
===========================

Some people find it noisy and distracting that the Org-mode headlines
are starting with a potentially large number of stars.  For example the
tree from *Note Headlines:::

     * Top level headline
     ** Second level
     *** 3rd level
         some text
     *** 3rd level
         more text
     * Another top level headline

Unfortunately this is deeply ingrained into the code of Org-mode and
cannot be easily changed.  You can, however, modify the display in such
a way that all leading stars become invisible and the outline more easy
to read.  To do this, customize the variable `org-hide-leading-stars'
like this:

     (setq org-hide-leading-stars t)

or change this on a per-file basis with one of the lines (anywhere in
the buffer)

     #+STARTUP: showstars
     #+STARTUP: hidestars

Press `C-c C-c' with the cursor in a `STARTUP' line to activate the
modifications.

   With stars hidden, the tree becomes:

     * Top level headline
      * Second level
       * 3rd level
         some text
       * 3rd level
         more text
     * Another top level headline

Note that the leading stars are not truly replaced by whitespace, they
are only fontified with the face `org-hide' that uses the background
color as font color.  If you are not using either white or black
background, you may have to customize this face to get the wanted
effect.  Another possibility is to set this font such that the extra
stars are almost invisible, for example using the color `grey90' on a
white background.

   Things become cleaner still if you skip all the even levels and use
only odd levels 1, 3, 5..., effectively adding two stars to go from one
outline level to the next:

     * Top level headline
       * Second level
         * 3rd level
           some text
         * 3rd level
           more text
     * Another top level headline

In order to make the structure editing and export commands handle this
convention correctly, use

     (setq org-odd-levels-only t)

or set this on a per-file basis with one of the following lines (don't
forget to press `C-c C-c' with the cursor in the startup line to
activate changes immediately).

     #+STARTUP: odd
     #+STARTUP: oddeven

   You can convert an Org-mode file from single-star-per-level to the
double-star-per-level convention with `M-x org-convert-to-odd-levels
RET' in that file.  The reverse operation is `M-x
org-convert-to-oddeven-levels'.

14.6 Using org-mode on a tty
============================

Org-mode uses a number of keys that are not accessible on a tty.  This
applies to most special keys like cursor keys, <TAB> and <RET>, when
these are combined with modifier keys like <Meta> and/or <Shift>.
Org-mode uses these bindings because it needs to provide keys for a
large number of commands, and because these keys appeared particularly
easy to remember.  In order to still be able to access the core
functionality of Org-mode on a tty, alternative bindings are provided.
Here is a complete list of these bindings, which are obviously more
cumbersome to use.  Note that sometimes a work-around can be better.
For example changing a time stamp is really only fun with `S-<cursor>'
keys.  On a tty you would rather use `C-c .'  to re-insert the
timestamp.

Default     Alternative 1  Alternative 2
`S-<TAB>'   `C-u <TAB>'    
`M-<left>'  `C-c C-x l'    `<Esc> <left>'
`M-S-<left>'`C-c C-x L'    
`M-<right>' `C-c C-x r'    `<Esc>
                           <right>'
`M-S-<right>'`C-c C-x R'    
`M-<up>'    `C-c C-x u'    `<Esc> <up>'
`M-S-<up>'  `C-c C-x U'    
`M-<down>'  `C-c C-x d'    `<Esc> <down>'
`M-S-<down>'`C-c C-x D'    
`S-<RET>'   `C-c C-x c'    
`M-<RET>'   `C-c C-x m'    `<Esc> <RET>'
`M-S-<RET>' `C-c C-x M'    
`S-<left>'  `C-c <left>'   
`S-<right>' `C-c <right>'  
`S-<up>'    `C-c <up>'     
`S-<down>'  `C-c <down>'   
`C-S-<left>'`C-c C-x       
            <left>'        
`C-S-<right>'`C-c C-x       
            <right>'

14.7 Interaction with other packages
====================================

Org-mode lives in the world of GNU Emacs and interacts in various ways
with other code out there.

* Menu:

* Cooperation::                 Packages Org-mode cooperates with
* Conflicts::                   Packages that lead to conflicts


File: org,  Node: Cooperation,  Next: Conflicts,  Prev: Interaction,  Up: Interaction

14.7.1 Packages that Org-mode cooperates with
---------------------------------------------

`calc.el' by Dave Gillespie
     Org-mode uses the calc package for implementing spreadsheet
     functionality in its tables (*note The spreadsheet::).  Org-mode
     checks for the availability of calc by looking for the function
     `calc-eval' which should be autoloaded in your setup if calc has
     been installed properly.  As of Emacs 22, calc is part of the Emacs
     distribution.  Another possibility for interaction between the two
     packages is using calc for embedded calculations. *Note Embedded
     Mode: (calc)Embedded Mode.  

`constants.el' by Carsten Dominik
     In a table formula (*note The spreadsheet::), it is possible to use
     names for natural constants or units.  Instead of defining your own
     constants in the variable `org-table-formula-constants', install
     the `constants' package which defines a large number of constants
     and units, and lets you use unit prefixes like `M' for `Mega' etc.
     You will need version 2.0 of this package, available at
     `http://www.astro.uva.nl/~dominik/Tools'. Org-mode checks for the
     function `constants-get', which has to be autoloaded in your
     setup.  See the installation instructions in the file
     `constants.el'.

`cdlatex.el' by Carsten Dominik
     Org-mode can make use of the cdlatex package to efficiently enter
     LaTeX fragments into Org-mode files. See *Note CDLaTeX mode::.

`imenu.el' by Ake Stenhoff and Lars Lindberg
     Imenu allows menu access to an index of items in a file.  Org-mode
     supports imenu - all you need to do to get the index is the
     following:
          (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
                    (lambda () 'imenu-add-to-menubar "Imenu"))
     By default the index is two levels deep - you can modify the depth
     using the option `org-imenu-depth'.

`remember.el' by John Wiegley
     Org mode cooperates with remember, see *Note Remember::.
     `Remember.el' is not part of Emacs, find it on the web.

`speedbar.el' by Eric M. Ludlam
     Speedbar is a package that creates a special frame displaying
     files and index items in files.  Org-mode supports speedbar and
     allows you to drill into Org-mode files directly from the
     speedbar.  It also allows to restrict the scope of agenda commands
     to a file or a subtree by using the command `<' in the speedbar
     frame.  

`table.el' by Takaaki Ota
     Complex ASCII tables with automatic line wrapping, column- and
     row-spanning, and alignment can be created using the Emacs table
     package by Takaaki Ota (`http://sourceforge.net/projects/table',
     and also part of Emacs 22).  When <TAB> or `C-c C-c' is pressed in
     such a table, Org-mode will call `table-recognize-table' and move
     the cursor into the table.  Inside a table, the keymap of Org-mode
     is inactive.  In order to execute Org-mode-related commands, leave
     the table.

    `C-c C-c'
          Recognize `table.el' table.  Works when the cursor is in a
          table.el table.  

    `C-c ~'
          Insert a table.el table.  If there is already a table at
          point, this command converts it between the table.el format
          and the Org-mode format.  See the documentation string of the
          command `org-convert-table' for the restrictions under which
          this is possible.
     `table.el' is part of Emacs 22.  

`footnote.el' by Steven L. Baur
     Org-mode recognizes numerical footnotes as provided by this package
     (*note Footnotes::).


File: org,  Node: Conflicts,  Prev: Cooperation,  Up: Interaction

14.7.2 Packages that lead to conflicts with Org-mode
----------------------------------------------------

`allout.el' by Ken Manheimer
     Startup of Org-mode may fail with the error message
     `(wrong-type-argument keymapp nil)' when there is an outdated
     version `allout.el' on the load path, for example the version
     distributed with Emacs 21.x.  Upgrade to Emacs 22 and this problem
     will disappear.  If for some reason you cannot do this, make sure
     that org.el is loaded _before_ `allout.el', for example by putting
     `(require 'org)' early enough into your `.emacs' file.

`CUA.el' by Kim. F. Storm
     Keybindings in Org-mode conflict with the `S-<cursor>' keys used by
     CUA-mode (as well as pc-select-mode and s-region-mode) to select
     and extend the region.  If you want to use one of these packages
     along with Org-mode, configure the variable
     `org-replace-disputed-keys'.  When set, Org-mode will move the
     following keybindings in Org-mode files, and in the agenda buffer
     (but not during date selection).

          S-UP    -> M-p             S-DOWN  -> M-n
          S-LEFT  -> M--             S-RIGHT -> M-+

     Yes, these are unfortunately more difficult to remember.  If you
     want to have other replacement keys, look at the variable
     `org-disputed-keys'.

`windmove.el' by Hovav Shacham
     Also this package uses the `S-<cursor>' keys, so everything written
     in the paragraph above about CUA mode also applies here.

`footnote.el' by Steven L. Baur
     Org-mode supports the syntax of the footnote package, but only the
     numerical footnote markers.  Also, the default key for footnote
     commands, `C-c !' is already used by Org-mode.  You could use the
     variable `footnote-prefix' to switch footnotes commands to another
     key.  Or, you could use `org-replace-disputed-keys' and
     `org-disputed-keys' to change the settings in Org-mode.

14.8 Bugs
=========

Here is a list of things that should work differently, but which I have
found too hard to fix.

   * If a table field starts with a link, and if the corresponding table
     column is narrowed (*note Narrow columns::) to a width too small to
     display the link, the field would look entirely empty even though
     it is not.  To prevent this, Org-mode throws an error.  The
     work-around is to make the column wide enough to fit the link, or
     to add some text (at least 2 characters) before the link in the
     same field.

   * Narrowing table columns does not work on XEmacs, because the
     `format' function does not transport text properties.

   * Text in an entry protected with the `QUOTE' keyword should not
     autowrap.

   * When the application called by `C-c C-o' to open a file link fails
     (for example because the application does not exist or refuses to
     open the file), it does so silently.  No error message is
     displayed.

   * Recalculating a table line applies the formulas from left to right.
     If a formula uses _calculated_ fields further down the row,
     multiple recalculation may be needed to get all fields consistent.
     You may use the command `org-table-iterate' (`C-u C-c *') to
     recalculate until convergence.

   * A single letter cannot be made bold, for example `*a*'.

   * The exporters work well, but could be made more efficient.

A.1 Third-party extensions for Org-mode
=======================================

The following extensions for Org-mode have been written by other people:

`org-publish.el' by David O'Toole
     This package provides facilities for publishing related sets of
     Org-mode files together with linked files like images as webpages.
     It is highly configurable and can be used for other publishing
     purposes as well.  As of Org-mode version 4.30, `org-publish.el'
     is part of the Org-mode distribution.  It is not yet part of
     Emacs, however, a delay caused by the preparations for the 22.1
     release.  In the mean time, `org-publish.el' can be downloaded
     from David's site: `http://dto.freeshell.org/e/org-publish.el'.  

`org-mouse.el' by Piotr Zielinski
     This package implements extended mouse functionality for Org-mode.
     It allows you to cycle visibility and to edit the document
     structure with the mouse.  Best of all, it provides a
     context-sensitive menu on <mouse-3> that changes depending on the
     context of a mouse-click.  As of Org-mode version 4.53,
     `org-mouse.el' is part of the Org-mode distribution.  It is not
     yet part of Emacs, however, a delay caused by the preparations for
     the 22.1 release.  In the mean time, `org-mouse.el' can be
     downloaded from Piotr's site:
     `http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pz215/files/org-mouse.el'.  

`org-blog.el' by David O'Toole
     A blogging plug-in for `org-publish.el'.
     `http://dto.freeshell.org/notebook/OrgMode.html'.  

`blorg.el' by Bastien Guerry
     Publish Org-mode files as blogs.
     `http://www.cognition.ens.fr/~guerry/blorg.html'.  

`org2rem.el' by Bastien Guerry
     Translates Org-mode files into something readable by Remind.
     `http://www.cognition.ens.fr/~guerry/u/org2rem.el'.

`org-toc.el' by Bastien Guerry
     Produces a simple table of contents of an Org-mode file, for easy
     navigation. `http://www.cognition.ens.fr/~guerry/u/org2rem.el'.

`org-registry.el' by Bastien Guerry
     Find which Org-file link to a certain document.
     `http://www.cognition.ens.fr/~guerry/u/org2rem.el'.

A.2 Adding hyperlink types
==========================

Org-mode has a large number of hyperlink types built-in (*note
Hyperlinks::).  If you would like to add new link types, it provides an
interface for doing so.  Lets look at an example file `org-man.el' that
will add support for creating links like `[[man:printf][The printf
manpage]]' to show unix manual pages inside emacs:

     ;;; org-man.el - Support for links to manpages in Org-mode

     (require 'org)

     (org-add-link-type "man" 'org-man-open)
     (add-hook 'org-store-link-functions 'org-man-store-link)

     (defcustom org-man-command 'man
       "The Emacs command to be used to display a man page."
       :group 'org-link
       :type '(choice (const man) (const woman)))

     (defun org-man-open (path)
       "Visit the manpage on PATH.
     PATH should be a topic that can be thrown at the man command."
       (funcall org-man-command path))

     (defun org-man-store-link ()
       "Store a link to a manpage."
       (when (memq major-mode '(Man-mode woman-mode))
         ;; This is a man page, we do make this link
         (let* ((page (org-man-get-page-name))
                (link (concat "man:" page))
                (description (format "Manpage for %s" page)))
           (org-store-link-props
            :type "man"
            :link link
            :description description))))

     (defun org-man-get-page-name ()
       "Extract the page name from the buffer name."
       ;; This works for both `Man-mode' and `woman-mode'.
       (if (string-match " \\(\\S-+\\)\\*" (buffer-name))
           (match-string 1 (buffer-name))
         (error "Cannot create link to this man page")))

     (provide 'org-man)

     ;;; org-man.el ends here

You would activate this new link type in `.emacs' with

     (require 'org-man)

Lets go through the file and see what it does.
  1. It does `(require 'org)' to make sure that `org.el' has been
     loaded.

  2. The next line calls `org-add-link-type' to define a new link type
     with prefix `man'.  The call also contains the name of a function
     that will be called to follow such a link.

  3. The next line adds a function to `org-store-link-functions', in
     order to allow the command `C-c l' to record a useful link in a
     buffer displaying a man page.

   The rest of the file defines the necessary variables and functions.
First there is a customization variable that determines which emacs
command should be used to display manpages.  There are two options,
`man' and `woman'.  Then the function to follow a link is defined.  It
gets the link path as an argument - in this case the link path is just
a topic for the manual command.  The function calls the value of
`org-man-command' to display the man page.

   Finally the function `org-man-store-link' is defined.  When you try
to store a link with `C-c l', also this function will be called to try
to make a link.  The function must first decide if it is supposed to
create the link for this buffer type, we do this by checking the value
of the variable `major-mode'.  If not, the function must exit and
retunr the value `nil'.  If yes, the link is created by getting the
manual tpoic from the buffer name and prefixing it with the string
`man:'.  Then it must call the command `org-store-link-props' and set
the `:type' and `:link' properties.  Optionally you can also set the
`:description' property to provide a default for the link description
when the link is later inserted into tan Org-mode buffer with `C-c C-l'.

A.3 Tables and Lists in arbitrary syntax
========================================

Since Orgtbl-mode can be used as a minor mode in arbitrary buffers, a
frequent feature request has been to make it work with native tables in
specific languages, for example LaTeX.  However, this is extremely hard
to do in a general way, would lead to a customization nightmare, and
would take away much of the simplicity of the Orgtbl-mode table editor.

   This appendix describes a different approach.  We keep the
Orgtbl-mode table in its native format (the source table), and use a
custom function to translate the table to the correct syntax, and to
install it in the right location (the target table).  This puts the
burden of writing conversion functions on the user, but it allows for a
very flexible system.

   Bastien added the ability to do the same with lists.  You can use
Org's facilities to edit and structure lists by turning `orgstruct-mode'
on, then locally exporting such lists in another format (HTML, LaTeX or
TeXInfo.)

* Menu:

* Radio tables::                Sending and receiving
* A LaTeX example::             Step by step, almost a tutorial
* Translator functions::        Copy and modify
* Radio lists::                 Doing the same for lists.


File: org,  Node: Radio tables,  Next: A LaTeX example,  Prev: Tables in arbitrary syntax,  Up: Tables in arbitrary syntax

A.3.1 Radio tables
------------------

To define the location of the target table, you first need to create two
lines that are comments in the current mode, but contain magic words for
Orgtbl-mode to find.  Orgtbl-mode will insert the translated table
between these lines, replacing whatever was there before.  For example:

     /* BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL table_name */
     /* END RECEIVE ORGTBL table_name */

Just above the source table, we put a special line that tells
Orgtbl-mode how to translate this table and where to install it.  For
example:
     #+ORGTBL: SEND table_name translation_function arguments....

`table_name' is the reference name for the table that is also used in
the receiver lines. `translation_function' is the Lisp function that
does the translation.  Furthermore, the line can contain a list of
arguments (alternating key and value) at the end.  The arguments will be
passed as a property list to the translation function for
interpretation.  A few standard parameters are already recognized and
acted upon before the translation function is called:

`:skip N'
     Skip the first N lines of the table. Hlines do count!

`:skipcols (n1 n2 ...)'
     List of columns that should be skipped.  If the table has a column
     with calculation marks, that column is automatically discarded as
     well.  Please note that the translator function sees the table
     _after_ the removal of these columns, the function never knows
     that there have been additional columns.

The one problem remaining is how to keep the source table in the buffer
without disturbing the normal workings of the file, for example during
compilation of a C file or processing of a LaTeX file.  There are a
number of different solutions:

   * The table could be placed in a block comment if that is supported
     by the language.  For example, in C-mode you could wrap the table
     between `/*' and `*/' lines.

   * Sometimes it is possible to put the table after some kind of END
     statement, for example `\bye' in TeX and `\end{document}' in LaTeX.

   * You can just comment the table line by line whenever you want to
     process the file, and uncomment it whenever you need to edit the
     table.  This only sounds tedious - the command `M-x
     orgtbl-toggle-comment' does make this comment-toggling very easy,
     in particular if you bind it to a key.

A.3.2 A LaTeX example of radio tables
-------------------------------------

The best way to wrap the source table in LaTeX is to use the `comment'
environment provided by `comment.sty'.  It has to be activated by
placing `\usepackage{comment}' into the document header.  Orgtbl-mode
can insert a radio table skeleton(1)  with the command `M-x
orgtbl-insert-radio-table'.  You will be prompted for a table name,
lets say we use `salesfigures'.  You will then get the following
template:

     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     % END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex
     | | |
     \end{comment}

The `#+ORGTBL: SEND' line tells orgtbl-mode to use the function
`orgtbl-to-latex' to convert the table into LaTeX and to put it into
the receiver location with name `salesfigures'.  You may now fill in
the table, feel free to use the spreadsheet features(2):

     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     % END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex
     | Month | Days | Nr sold | per day |
     |-------+------+---------+---------|
     | Jan   |   23 |      55 |     2.4 |
     | Feb   |   21 |      16 |     0.8 |
     | March |   22 |     278 |    12.6 |
     #+TBLFM: $4=$3/$2;%.1f
     % $ (optional extra dollar to keep font-lock happy, see footnote)
     \end{comment}

When you are done, press `C-c C-c' in the table to get the converted
table inserted between the two marker lines.

   Now lets assume you want to make the table header by hand, because
you want to control how columns are aligned etc.  In this case we make
sure that the table translator does skip the first 2 lines of the source
table, and tell the command to work as a splice, i.e. to not produce
header and footer commands of the target table:

     \begin{tabular}{lrrr}
     Month & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Days} & Nr.\ sold & per day\\
     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     % END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
     \end{tabular}
     %
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex :splice t :skip 2
     | Month | Days | Nr sold | per day |
     |-------+------+---------+---------|
     | Jan   |   23 |      55 |     2.4 |
     | Feb   |   21 |      16 |     0.8 |
     | March |   22 |     278 |    12.6 |
     #+TBLFM: $4=$3/$2;%.1f
     \end{comment}

   The LaTeX translator function `orgtbl-to-latex' is already part of
Orgtbl-mode.  It uses a `tabular' environment to typeset the table and
marks horizontal lines with `\hline'.  Furthermore, it interprets the
following parameters:

`:splice nil/t'
     When set to t, return only table body lines, don't wrap them into a
     tabular environment.  Default is nil.

`:fmt fmt'
     A format to be used to wrap each field, should contain `%s' for the
     original field value.  For example, to wrap each field value in
     dollars, you could use `:fmt "$%s$"'.  This may also be a property
     list with column numbers and formats. for example `:fmt (2 "$%s$"
     4 "%s\\%%")'.

`:efmt efmt'
     Use this format to print numbers with exponentials.  The format
     should have `%s' twice for inserting mantissa and exponent, for
     example `"%s\\times10^{%s}"'.  The default is `"%s\\,(%s)"'.  This
     may also be a property list with column numbers and formats, for
     example `:efmt (2 "$%s\\times10^{%s}$" 4 "$%s\\cdot10^{%s}$")'.
     After `efmt' has been applied to a value, `fmt' will also be
     applied.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) By default this works only for LaTeX, HTML, and TeXInfo.
Configure the variable `orgtbl-radio-tables' to install templates for
other modes.

   (2) If the `#+TBLFM' line contains an odd number of dollar
characters, this may cause problems with font-lock in latex-mode.  As
shown in the example you can fix this by adding an extra line inside the
`comment' environment that is used to balance the dollar expressions.
If you are using AUCTeX with the font-latex library, a much better
solution is to add the `comment' environment to the variable
`LaTeX-verbatim-environments'.

A.3.3 Translator functions
--------------------------

Orgtbl-mode has several translator functions built-in:
`orgtbl-to-latex', `orgtbl-to-html', and `orgtbl-to-texinfo'.  Except
for `orgtbl-to-html'(1), these all use a generic translator,
`orgtbl-to-generic'.  For example, `orgtbl-to-latex' itself is a very
short function that computes the column definitions for the `tabular'
environment, defines a few field and line separators and then hands
over to the generic translator.  Here is the entire code:

     (defun orgtbl-to-latex (table params)
       "Convert the orgtbl-mode TABLE to LaTeX."
       (let* ((alignment (mapconcat (lambda (x) (if x "r" "l"))
                                    org-table-last-alignment ""))
              (params2
               (list
                :tstart (concat "\\begin{tabular}{" alignment "}")
                :tend "\\end{tabular}"
                :lstart "" :lend " \\\\" :sep " & "
                :efmt "%s\\,(%s)" :hline "\\hline")))
         (orgtbl-to-generic table (org-combine-plists params2 params))))

   As you can see, the properties passed into the function (variable
PARAMS) are combined with the ones newly defined in the function
(variable PARAMS2).  The ones passed into the function (i.e. the ones
set by the `ORGTBL SEND' line) take precedence.  So if you would like
to use the LaTeX translator, but wanted the line endings to be
`\\[2mm]' instead of the default `\\', you could just overrule the
default with

     #+ORGTBL: SEND test orgtbl-to-latex :lend " \\\\[2mm]"

   For a new language, you can either write your own converter function
in analogy with the LaTeX translator, or you can use the generic
function directly.  For example, if you have a language where a table
is started with `!BTBL!', ended with `!ETBL!', and where table lines are
started with `!BL!', ended with `!EL!' and where the field separator is
a TAB, you could call the generic translator like this (on a single
line!):

     #+ORGTBL: SEND test orgtbl-to-generic :tstart "!BTBL!" :tend "!ETBL!"
                                   :lstart "!BL! " :lend " !EL!" :sep "\t"

Please check the documentation string of the function
`orgtbl-to-generic' for a full list of parameters understood by that
function and remember that you can pass each of them into
`orgtbl-to-latex', `orgtbl-to-texinfo', and any other function using
the generic function.

   Of course you can also write a completely new function doing
complicated things the generic translator cannot do.  A translator
function takes two arguments.  The first argument is the table, a list
of lines, each line either the symbol `hline' or a list of fields.  The
second argument is the property list containing all parameters
specified in the `#+ORGTBL: SEND' line.  The function must return a
single string containing the formatted table.  If you write a generally
useful translator, please post it on `emacs-orgmode@gnu.org' so that
others can benefit from your work.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The HTML translator uses the same code that produces tables
during HTML export.


File: org,  Node: Radio lists,  Prev: Translator functions,  Up: Tables in arbitrary syntax

A.3.4 Radio lists
-----------------

Sending and receiving radio lists works exactly the same way than
sending and receiving radio tables (*note Radio tables::) (1).  As for
radio tables, you can insert radio lists templates in HTML, LaTeX and
TeXInfo modes by calling `org-list-insert-radio-list'.

   Here are the differences with radio tables:

   - Use `ORGLST' instead of `ORGTBL'.

   - The available translation functions for radio lists don't take
     parameters.

   - `C-c C-c' will work when pressed on the first item of the list.

   Here is a LaTeX example.  Let's say that you have this in your LaTeX
file:

     % BEGIN RECEIVE ORGLST to-buy
     % END RECEIVE ORGLST to-buy
     \begin{comment}
     #+ORGLIST: SEND to-buy orgtbl-to-latex
     - a new house
     - a new computer
       + a new keyboard
       + a new mouse
     - a new life
     \end{comment}

   Pressing `C-c C-c' on `a new house' and will insert the converted
LaTeX list between the two marker lines.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) You need to load the `org-export-latex.el' package to use radio
lists since the relevant code is there for now.


File: org,  Node: Dynamic blocks,  Next: Special agenda views,  Prev: Tables in arbitrary syntax,  Up: Extensions and Hacking

A.4 Dynamic blocks
==================

Org-mode documents can contain _dynamic blocks_.  These are specially
marked regions that are updated by some user-written function.  A good
example for such a block is the clock table inserted by the command
`C-c C-x C-r' (*note Clocking work time::).

   Dynamic block are enclosed by a BEGIN-END structure that assigns a
name to the block and can also specify parameters for the function
producing the content of the block.

     #+BEGIN: myblock :parameter1 value1 :parameter2 value2 ...

     #+END:

   Dynamic blocks are updated with the following commands

`C-c C-x C-u'
     Update dynamic block at point.  

`C-u C-c C-x C-u'
     Update all dynamic blocks in the current file.

   Updating a dynamic block means to remove all the text between BEGIN
and END, parse the BEGIN line for parameters and then call the specific
writer function for this block to insert the new content.  For a block
with name `myblock', the writer function is `org-dblock-write:myblock'
with as only parameter a property list with the parameters given in the
begin line.  Here is a trivial example of a block that keeps track of
when the block update function was last run:

     #+BEGIN: block-update-time :format "on %m/%d/%Y at %H:%M"

     #+END:

The corresponding block writer function could look like this:

     (defun org-dblock-write:block-update-time (params)
        (let ((fmt (or (plist-get params :format) "%d. %m. %Y")))
          (insert "Last block update at: "
                  (format-time-string fmt (current-time)))))

   If you want to make sure that all dynamic blocks are always
up-to-date, you could add the function `org-update-all-dblocks' to a
hook, for example `before-save-hook'.  `org-update-all-dblocks' is
written in a way that is does nothing in buffers that are not in
Org-mode.


File: org,  Node: Special agenda views,  Next: Using the property API,  Prev: Dynamic blocks,  Up: Extensions and Hacking

A.5 Special Agenda Views
========================

Org-mode provides a special hook that can be used to narrow down the
selection made by any of the agenda views.  You may specify a function
that is used at each match to verify if the match should indeed be part
of the agenda view, and if not, how much should be skipped.

   Let's say you want to produce a list of projects that contain a
WAITING tag anywhere in the project tree.  Let's further assume that
you have marked all tree headings that define a project with the todo
keyword PROJECT.  In this case you would run a todo search for the
keyword PROJECT, but skip the match unless there is a WAITING tag
anywhere in the subtree belonging to the project line.

   To achieve this, you must write a function that searches the subtree
for the tag.  If the tag is found, the function must return `nil' to
indicate that this match should not be skipped.  If there is no such
tag, return the location of the end of the subtree, to indicate that
search should continue from there.

     (defun my-skip-unless-waiting ()
       "Skip trees that are not waiting"
       (let ((subtree-end (save-excursion (org-end-of-subtree t))))
         (if (re-search-forward ":WAITING:" subtree-end t)
             nil          ; tag found, do not skip
           subtree-end))) ; tag not found, continue after end of subtree

   Now you may use this function in an agenda custom command, for
example like this:

     (org-add-agenda-custom-command
      '("b" todo "PROJECT"
        ((org-agenda-skip-function 'my-org-waiting-projects)
         (org-agenda-overriding-header "Projects waiting for something: "))))

   Note that this also binds `org-agenda-overriding-header' to get a
meaningful header in the agenda view.

   You may also put a Lisp form into `org-agenda-skip-function'.  In
particular, you may use the functions `org-agenda-skip-entry-if' and
`org-agenda-skip-subtree-if' in this form, for example:

`'(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled)'
     Skip current entry if it has been scheduled.

`'(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'notscheduled)'
     Skip current entry if it has not been scheduled.

`'(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'deadline)'
     Skip current entry if it has a deadline.

`'(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled 'deadline)'
     Skip current entry if it has a deadline, or if it is scheduled.

`'(org-agenda-skip-entry 'regexp "regular expression")'
     Skip current entry if the regular expression matches in the entry.

`'(org-agenda-skip-entry 'notregexp "regular expression")'
     Skip current entry unless the regular expression matches.

`'(org-agenda-skip-subtree-if 'regexp "regular expression")'
     Same as above, but check and skip the entire subtree.

   Therefore we could also have written the search for WAITING projects
like this, even without defining a special function:

     (org-add-agenda-custom-command
      '("b" todo "PROJECT"
        ((org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-subtree-if
                                     'regexp ":WAITING:"))
         (org-agenda-overriding-header "Projects waiting for something: "))))


File: org,  Node: Using the property API,  Prev: Special agenda views,  Up: Extensions and Hacking

A.6 Using the property API
==========================

Here is a description of the functions that can be used to work with
properties.

 -- Function: org-entry-properties &optional pom which
     Get all properties of the entry at point-or-marker POM.  This
     includes the TODO keyword, the tags, time strings for deadline,
     scheduled, and clocking, and any additional properties defined in
     the entry.  The return value is an alist, keys may occur multiple
     times if the property key was used several times.  POM may also be
     nil, in which case the current entry is used.  If WHICH is nil or
     `all', get all properties.  If WHICH is `special' or `standard',
     only get that subclass.

 -- Function: org-entry-get pom property &optional inherit
     Get value of PROPERTY for entry at point-or-marker POM.  If
     INHERIT is non-nil and the entry does not have the property, then
     also check higher levels of the hierarchy.  This function ignores
     the value of `org-use-property-inheritance' and requires the
     explicit INHERIT flag.

 -- Function: org-entry-delete pom property
     Delete the property PROPERTY from entry at point-or-marker POM.

 -- Function: org-entry-put pom property value
     Set PROPERTY to VALUE for entry at point-or-marker POM.

 -- Function: org-buffer-property-keys &optional include-specials
     Get all property keys in the current buffer.

 -- Function: org-insert-property-drawer
     Insert a property drawer at point.

Appendix B History and Acknowledgments
**************************************

Org-mode was borne in 2003, out of frustration over the user interface
of the Emacs outline-mode.  I was trying to organize my notes and
projects, and using Emacs seemed to be the natural way to go.  However,
having to remember eleven different commands with two or three keys per
command, only to hide and unhide parts of the outline tree, that seemed
entirely unacceptable to me.  Also, when using outlines to take notes, I
constantly want to restructure the tree, organizing it parallel to my
thoughts and plans.  _Visibility cycling_ and _structure editing_ were
originally implemented in the package `outline-magic.el', but quickly
moved to the more general `org.el'.  As this environment became
comfortable for project planning, the next step was adding _TODO
entries_, basic _time stamps_, and _table support_.  These areas
highlight the two main goals that Org-mode still has today: To create a
new, outline-based, plain text mode with innovative and intuitive
editing features, and to incorporate project planning functionality
directly into a notes file.

   Since the first release, literally thousands of emails to me or on
`emacs-orgmode@gnu.org' have provided a constant stream of bug reports,
feedback, new ideas, and sometimes patches and add-on code.  Many
thanks to everyone who has helped to improve this package.  I am trying
to keep here a list of the people who had significant influence in
shaping one or more aspects of Org-mode.  The list may not be complete,
if I have forgotten someone, please accept my apologies and let me know.

   * Russel Adams came up with the idea for drawers.

   * Thomas Baumann contributed the code for links to the MH-E email
     system.

   * Alex Bochannek provided a patch for rounding time stamps.

   * Charles Cave's suggestion sparked the implementation of templates
     for Remember.

   * Pavel Chalmoviansky influenced the agenda treatment of items with
     specified time.

   * Gregory Chernov patched support for lisp forms into table
     calculations and improved XEmacs compatibility, in particular by
     porting `nouline.el' to XEmacs.

   * Sacha Chua suggested to copy some linking code from Planner.

   * Eddward DeVilla proposed and tested checkbox statistics.  He also
     came up with the idea of properties, and that there should be an
     API for them.

   * Kees Dullemond used to edit projects lists directly in HTML and so
     inspired some of the early development, including HTML export.  He
     also asked for a way to narrow wide table columns.

   * Christian Egli converted the documentation into TeXInfo format,
     patched CSS formatting into the HTML exporter, and inspired the
     agenda.

   * David Emery provided a patch for custom CSS support in exported
     HTML agendas.

   * Nic Ferrier contributed mailcap and XOXO support.

   * John Foerch figured out how to make incremental search show context
     around a match in a hidden outline tree.

   * Niels Giesen had the idea to automatically archive DONE trees.

   * Bastien Guerry wrote the LaTeX exporter and has been prolific with
     patches, ideas, and bug reports.

   * Kai Grossjohann pointed out key-binding conflicts with other
     packages.

   * Scott Jaderholm proposed footnotes, control over whitespace between
     folded entries, and column view for properties.

   * Shidai Liu ("Leo") asked for embedded LaTeX and tested it.  He also
     provided frequent feedback and some patches.

   * Jason F. McBrayer suggested agenda export to CSV format.

   * Max Mikhanosha came up with the idea of refiling.

   * Dmitri Minaev sent a patch to set priority limits on a per-file
     basis.

   * Stefan Monnier provided a patch to keep the Emacs-Lisp compiler
     happy.

   * Rick Moynihan proposed to allow multiple TODO sequences in a file
     and to be able to quickly restrict the agenda to a subtree.

   * Todd Neal provided patches for links to Info files and elisp forms.

   * Tim O'Callaghan suggested in-file links, search options for general
     file links, and TAGS.

   * Takeshi Okano translated the manual and David O'Toole's tutorial
     into Japanese.

   * Oliver Oppitz suggested multi-state TODO items.

   * Scott Otterson sparked the introduction of descriptive text for
     links, among other things.

   * Pete Phillips helped during the development of the TAGS feature,
     and provided frequent feedback.

   * T.V. Raman reported bugs and suggested improvements.

   * Matthias Rempe (Oelde) provided ideas, Windows support, and quality
     control.

   * Kevin Rogers contributed code to access VM files on remote hosts.

   * Frank Ruell solved the mystery of the `keymapp nil' bug, a
     conflict with `allout.el'.

   * Jason Riedy sent a patch to fix a bug with export of TODO keywords.

   * Philip Rooke created the Org-mode reference card and provided lots
     of feedback.

   * Christian Schlauer proposed angular brackets around links, among
     other things.

   * Linking to VM/BBDB/GNUS was inspired by Tom Shannon's
     `organizer-mode.el'.

   * Daniel Sinder came up with the idea of internal archiving by
     locking subtrees.

   * Dale Smith proposed link abbreviations.

   * Adam Spiers asked for global linking commands and inspired the link
     extension system.  support mairix.

   * David O'Toole wrote `org-publish.el' and drafted the manual
     chapter about publishing.

   * Ju"rgen Vollmer contributed code generating the table of contents
     in HTML output.

   * Chris Wallace provided a patch implementing the `QUOTE' keyword.

   * David Wainberg suggested archiving, and improvements to the linking
     system.

   * John Wiegley wrote `emacs-wiki.el' and `planner.el'.  The
     development of Org-mode was fully independent, and both systems are
     really different beasts in their basic ideas and implementation
     details.  I later looked at John's code, however, and learned from
     his implementation of (i) links where the link itself is hidden
     and only a description is shown, and (ii) popping up a calendar to
     select a date.  John has also contributed a number of great ideas
     directly to Org-mode.

   * Carsten Wimmer suggested some changes and helped fix a bug in
     linking to GNUS.

   * Roland Winkler requested additional keybindings to make Org-mode
     work on a tty.

   * Piotr Zielinski wrote `org-mouse.el', proposed agenda blocks and
     contributed various ideas and code snippets.
