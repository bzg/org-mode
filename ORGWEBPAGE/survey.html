<h2 id="sec-1">Survey introduction</h2>


<p>
A survey was conducted of org-mode users duing November 2007.  An
invitation was sent to the org-mode users list as well as announced on
the <a href="http://orgmode.org">http://orgmode.org</a> web site.  About 80 people resonded.  This file
contains a complete list of the answers, as the base of further
discussion.

<h2 id="sec-4">3. When did you first start using org-mode and how did you find out about it?</h2>


<ul>
<li>
Org 5.04, Aug 2007 - Searching around the Web 
</li>
<li>
2007, December found about in in emacs wiki
</li>
<li>
November 2006, found it while googling GTD tools      
</li>
<li>
moved from planner about 6 months ago
</li>
<li>
2005, probably read about it on Sacha Chua's blog.
</li>
<li>
August 2007? Heard of it a long time ago, maybe by following links
from johnh's notebook mode. Finally switched from planner after a
friend did the same.
</li>
<li>
October 2007
</li>
<li>
about the begining of 2007. Heard about it on the internet I guess.
</li>
<li>
I found it by way of emacswiki.org. I was an avid user of outline
mode, and found somebody's screencast (Scott Jaderholm's, I think)
showing off org mode. I've been using it for probably about six
months.       
</li>
<li>
Oct. 2007. I think I was looking for an alternative to planner.el.
</li>
<li>
august 27, 2006. I found it while looking for an alternative to
planner.      
</li>
<li>
Roughly 2005/6, through a friend.     
</li>
<li>
2007-Nov. Google.
</li>
<li>
July 2007 after I saw the entry in Emacswiki
</li>
<li>
april 2007
</li>
<li>
2007-06 thrrough Sacha Chua's blog
</li>
<li>
Oldest entry in my archive file is June 2005, but I think I was
using org for a while before that. I don't remember when I heard
about it.
</li>
<li>
Around version 4.76, don't remember when. Found about it on the
Emacs Wiki.   
</li>
<li>
10/2006 by chance looking for pim tools for Emacs
</li>
<li>
One month ago, found a link on a web site
</li>
<li>
11/2005
</li>
<li>
02/2007 After getting annoyed with Muse-mode interaction with
outline-mode, I googled and found org-mode and never went back.
</li>
<li>
Using for about 2 years. Found org-mode after searching for a better
version of outline-mode
</li>
<li>
Sometime around Jan. 2005. Someone mentioned it on the 43folders.com
message board (probably Jason F. McBrayer) and I decided I'd check
it out.
</li>
<li>
August 2007. I heard it about it on the planner mode mailing list.    
</li>
<li>
6-12 months ago!
</li>
<li>
I read about org-mail from an email of a maillist &hellip; dnon't know
which one
</li>
<li>
A year ago because someone mentioned it in #emacs on freenode as a
better planner-el solution    
</li>
<li>
2 months ago when I started using Emacs. I was also looking for a
way to organize and found org-mode via blogs etc.
</li>
<li>
3 month ago. I was looking forward some emacs "PIM".
</li>
<li>
2007 September
</li>
<li>
Can't remember; at least two years ago? I think I would have first
heard about it from the Emacs Wiki.
</li>
<li>
Around May 2007. I don't recall.      
</li>
<li>
No idea 6 months back probably; on the wiki site I think
</li>
<li>
2007-08 First heard mention in a GTD mailing list, but realised it
was going to be great after seeing screencast at
<a href="http://jaderholm.com/screencasts.html">http://jaderholm.com/screencasts.html</a> 
</li>
<li>
2007
</li>
<li>
almost 2 years emacs newsgroups
</li>
<li>
2006-08 (version 4.50)
</li>
<li>
approx. March 2006. I don't recall how I found out about it.  
</li>
<li>
I think I began using it in 2005. I found out about it on the
planner list. 
</li>
<li>
it's been about a year, I can't remember how I found out about it,
maybe on the #emacs channel IRC.      
</li>
<li>
2007-03 www.emacswiki.org     
</li>
<li>
1/2007 emacs NEWS
</li>
<li>
In 2005, I found out about org-mode while googling for some kind of
outliner software. My search must have hit upon a listserv post. My
first try at using it was in June 2005, but I didn't like
it. Carsten made many improvements and in December 2005, he emailed
me to ask me what I thought. It thought it was pretty good, and I've
been using it almost every day since.
</li>
<li>
October 2006. Saw orgmode mentioned in comments on 43folders.com
</li>
<li>
2007 july, emacs wiki 
</li>
<li>
Around September 2007. I first knew it from planner-mode mailing
list. I used to use planner-mode.
</li>
<li>
Oct 2007
</li>
<li>
2007-09 NEWS in Gnu Emacs 22
</li>
<li>
21 april 2006 (was the oldest .org file I could find on my
system). Found out through&hellip; #emacs I think. dto was talking about
it.
</li>
<li>
I have a "org version 3.05" in my .emacs So it should be from spring
2005 (March? May?) I read an article in the web, a blog I think. so
I began using Emacs to use org (uh! :-)
</li>
<li>
August 2007 Slashdot article on GTD Wired article on GTD Google
search for GTD found org-mode tutorial.
</li>
<li>
Sep 2005
</li>
<li>
June 2007. At may I started learning Emacs for the first time, and
together all its related modes. At #emacs at irc.freenode.org and at
EmacsWiki it was mentioned org-mode.
</li>
<li>
2007-04 I was into emacs learning and stumbled upon org-mode I don't
remember where.       
</li>
<li>
2007 February, emacswiki.org and discussions on the planner.el
mailing list  
</li>
<li>
Sometime before April 2006
</li>
<li>
About 1 year ago.
</li>
<li>
April 2006 (ca org-mode 4.25) Switching from Planner after numerous
mentions of org on the planner mailing list.
</li>
<li>
October 2006  
</li>
<li>
In june 2006. By reading the tutorial here:
<a href="http://dto.freeshell.org/notebook/OrgTutorial.html">http://dto.freeshell.org/notebook/OrgTutorial.html</a>
</li>
<li>
Aug 2005 After trying out Sacha's planning mode i knew it was close,
but not quite right for me. Googling around I found org mode.
</li>
<li>
Probably 2004, before it had texinfo documentation or even before
the agenda view       
</li>
<li>
2007/10
</li>
<li>
2007-01 I think I've read a blog about it or I've stumbled across it
at emacswiki.org.
</li>
<li>
I started to use org-mode a year ago. I found org-mode on the emacs
wiki  
</li>
<li>
2007, September, read about it on the pages explaining how it was
part of emacs-22
</li>
<li>
November-December 2006, after googling for "emacs pim". Or,
probably, there was an article (linux.com?).
</li>
<li>
5/2006, after emacswiki or web tutorial       
</li>
<li>
at least as long as the newsgroup has been gmane, as I submitted it
there. I must have found out on emacs wiki?   
</li>
<li>
~March 2007. I was using planner and I think I saw references to it
there and checked it out.     
</li>
<li>
I subscribed to the list in 8/06. Maybe a month or two before that.
</li>
<li>
2007-01-01
</li>
<li>
2007/01, by a org-mode tutorial.
</li>
<li>
I can't remember that. I used to use planner-mode. When someone
mentioned org-mode on that mailing list, I decided to have a try.
</li>
<li>
2006-03 &ndash; via your (Charles Cave) posting of 2006-03-10 to Getting Things Done
yahoogroup.
</li>
<li>
Around march 2006?     
</li>
<li>
Dunno. A while ago.
</li>
<li>
2006 found out indirectly from the Planner mode or maybe Emacs Wiki
</li>

schedules) replacement for spreadsheet helper in LaTeX modes
(orgtbl-mode)

</li>
<li>
1.) Note taking: web links, links to lines of code I'm working on,
bibtex entries. 2.) Brainstorming. When I'm trying to figure out how
to do something, I often fire up org-mode, dump a bunch of random
thoughts into it, and then organize it into something that makes
sense. 3.) Experiment logging. I use table node to store pretty much
all the results I've accumulated for my PhD thesis. 4.) TODO
lists. I thought I'd use the GTD capabilities on org-mode but can't
force myself to do it. But still, for little projects, I use the
TODO lists.

day planner (in agenda view) - generation of hipsterPDA - easy
folding documentation tool (write text docu, use folding to hide
sections I'm not working on currently, and finally generate html or
LaTeX

GTD / Agenda  
</li>
<li>
I organize all my projects and appointments with org.
</li>
<li>
Mainly todos/tasks planning and follow up
</li>
<li>
I use it to keep track of articles I have to write for clients (I'm
a journalist). I keep a page per client. I also use it to keep notes
on personal stuff, such as sport activities, todo things around the
house, garden and so on       
</li>
<li>
advanced todo list, reading diary, simple HTML authoring.     
</li>

Project management
</li>
<li>
note taking, task management, document creation, webpage publishing

more time in emacs/org.       
</li>

<h2 id="sec-6">5. New features and product maturity?</h2>


<p>
Original question:
</p>
<p>
What new features (if any) would you like to see in org-mode or do you
think the product has reached maturity?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
case sensitive search in tag completition - multilingual day name
input product has reached maturity in my opinion      
</li>
<li>
nothing (for now)      
</li>
<li>
A way to make it more Gnome friendly would be nice. In the case that
you don't have emacs started, you lose your ideas until you can note
them down.
</li>
<li>
I still haven't learnt enough to fully customize my environment.
</li>
<li>
Nothing specific, but I love the current state of development.
</li>
<li>
Syncing todos to other devices such as cellphones and palms, I know
it would not be very easy to do but would be extremely useful 
</li>
<li>
No idea, sorry. I think it has enough features at present that seems
a bit intimidating, really. (Minor quibble &ndash; I changed some of the
keybindings. I prefer M-left/right to hide/show subtrees, rather
than cycling with tab, and use # instead of * for outline
levels. This is mostly habits from a "todo-mode" used on emacs
in-house where I work.)
</li>
<li>
I'm on the lookout for a cell phone that runs Emacs, but&hellip; I haven't
found any mechanisms for remotely adding/editing timestamps,
changing the state of TODO items, etc. Neither have I found a way to
trigger reminder sounds, e-mails, phone calls, or IM messages. I'm
not sure about the best way to approach "mobile org-mode"&hellip; A
web-interface like Webjimbo? More robust import/export/sync to iCal
or GData? If we can find a way to usefully sync org-mode with mobile
devices, it'll be just about perfect.
</li>
<li>
Current features are enough for me.   
</li>
<li>
It is certainly mature. However I would also like to be able to use
it as a wiki and general-purpose document authoring/publishing
tool. In an ideal (and possibly unrealistic) world I would love to
see unification with muse-mode. To what extent is this possible?
</li>
<li>
I am still too new to it to comment on this.  
</li>
<li>
It's quite mature and I surely don't master it. What I'd like to see
is easier manipulation of the agenda export.
</li>
<li>
Compatibility with other wiki syntax (importer or exporter)
</li>
<li>
too soon to know      
</li>
<li>
Basically mature; I'd like to see refinement within the current
feature set.
</li>
<li>
You can always add new features! I would like to see an easy way to
tell how old my entries are. I would like to be able to derive a
task order based on importance and age (for tasks that don't have a
deadline but must be completed eventually). Also I would like to see
it integrated with other tools. I think a MindMap converter (for
FreeMind) would be cool - although it probably could be an external
script.       
</li>
<li>
Export to WordprocessingML would be perfect. Currently I export to
HTML and read the reports into Word, saving them as *.doc. But you
loose some features and details doing this.   
</li>
<li>
Integration out-of-the-box with remote calendar systems like Google
Calendar
</li>
<li>
Close to maturity. Some new features would be nice, but not terribly
important: Keeping root to leaf tree structure when archiving part
of a subtree. Simple dependent todos (i.e. dependent todo moves into
"NEXT" state when previous todo is marked "DONE"). Exporting entries
in HTML in monospaced font by default (i.e. without specially
marking individual entries). Auto-sorting of entries within a single
parent node (e.g. when a node is marked "DONE", move it lower in the
parent's list of todos). Integration with project management
software.
</li>
<li>
Some kind of resolution to the line wrapping issue with headlines.    
</li>
<li>
Simpler ways of doing things (perhaps with mouse commands)
</li>
<li>
I'd say it's pretty close to maturity. I haven't used most of the
more recently-added advanced features.
</li>
<li>
I'd like easier customization of "workflow" steps that would make it
easier to update states and record notes related to state changes
(and skip these notes when the state transitions are obvious in
nature).      
</li>
<li>
No immediate demands. I do not think the project has reached
maturity.
</li>
<li>
This product has reached maturity since long! In my point of view
this is. Excellent work!      
</li>
<li>
depending tasks - integrated pdf-generation (especially for
windows) - visualisation for tasks (like gantt) - a minor mode for
contacts like vcard.el
</li>
<li>
I think it reached maturity. It would be nice to have some minor
things, like a posibility to insert todo's right inside your project
source code and then have them added in agenda automatically. 
</li>
<li>
Instead of new features, I'd much prefer keeping XEmacs
compatibility 
</li>
<li>
Wishlist - Adding arbitrary (user specified) relations between nodes
with a specific relation name. for example, x &lt;part of&gt; y; where x
and y are two nodes. - Making the above functionality work between
files - making the above work between nodes published on a
distributed server In the GNU project GNOWSYS, we do this, where it
is a web application. We are now exploring how org mode can be used
as a client to manage the data published in GNOWSYS. Out team would
be more than willing to collaborate, but our team members are all
Python hackers, and use Emacs only for coding
</li>
<li>
I am having trouble keeping up with the many new features of the
last few months!
</li>
<li>
I think it is mature enough for me
</li>
<li>
automatic reminders in Emacs as pop ups?
</li>
<li>
I'm quite content as it is. I guess I could probably think of one or
two things, but I wouldn't want to spoil its power/simplicity
balance.
</li>
<li>
 planing times for tasks and compare them to actuel used times (and
also give out a warning if to many hours are planed for one day) -
agenda export to latex - simple project management
</li>
<li>
a gtd framework would be a killer feature!! more visual effects with
overlays However, it's "dÅÈjÅ‡" a very good work. Thanks.
</li>
<li>
very mature
</li>
<li>
Nearing maturity, but then again, maybe I'm just out of ideas.
</li>
<li>
I would like org-mode (or other parts of it like orgtbl) to become a
minor mode so I can turn it on/off in other buffers (mainly
muse). For example I would love to use todo list editing features in
emails. 
</li>
<li>
I don't understant all the features yet :)    
</li>
<li>
export facilitie
</li>
<li>
New features, in order of importance to me: 1.) A way to select a
chunk of text in firefox and paste it into org-mode, along with a
nicely formatted URL link. I would use this many times a day. MS
OneNote does this well. 2.) A way to link to email in an IMAP
folder. Preferably, this link would point directly to the email on
the IMAP server. The link should look like all the other links, and
you should be able to just drag it from, say, Thunderbird, into
org-mode, although a Thunderbird keyboard shortcut would be nice. I
would use this every day. 3.) More flexible outline prefixes. You
should be able to make headlines of this type: I. asdlfk i. asdfj
ii. asdlfkj II. &hellip; Or 1. Introduction 1.1 asdfkj 1.2
asdfkl 2. Background &hellip; Emacs hyperbole:
<a href="http://directory.fsf.org/project/hyperbole/">http://directory.fsf.org/project/hyperbole/</a> did this
beautifully. 4.) Internal links search in a way consistent with
emacs search (Ctrl-s). When you click on a link, it should go
towards the end of the buffer for the next match. When there's
nothing towards the end, it should wrap to the top. 5.) Fix the
underline/bold/italic stuff (if that is a new feature) 6.) Better
formatted html table export
</li>
<li>
Better support for working with others.       
</li>
<li>
I would like to see different way to view or summarize ageda. Like
progress, next possible todo
</li>
<li>
I think org-mode is quite mature now except there may be still some
bugs in it and some features may need more polish
</li>
<li>
Too novice a user yet to comment
</li>
<li>
can't tell yet.       
</li>
<li>
I like to be surprised more than wishing
</li>
<li>
I'd like better integration with calendar mode of
emacs. Specifically, when using the calendar, the command 'i d' to
insert an appointment, the diary file is used. I'd like to set a
headline in my orgmode buffer for that insert, for consistency with
the calendar entries I make by hand while processing my inbox Also,
navigation from agenda to org-file is easy. navigating back is
harder.
</li>
<li>
possibly nested numbered lists: 1. head 1 1.1 sub-head 1 1.2
sub-head 2 Also lettered lists: a. point a b. point b but I'm
already quite satisfied
</li>
<li>
 implement all features of muse-mode. Ex: list of pages, backlinks,
following links with Enter, &hellip; - consistent and clear syntax for
formatting text, which doesn't require memorizing use cases or
exceptions (ex: <b>a</b> isn't bold)
</li>
<li>
syncing with my palm would be the greatest need. (syncing with
outlook would do the job as outlook is snced with the palm)
</li>
<li>
mostly small things like an isearch mode that only matches headlines
(and doesn't auto expand), an allout-copy-exposed-to-buffer
equivalent, hipster pda publishing
</li>
<li>
I've too many ideas to write here. The only thing i can think of is
not quite org related. A published bison or antlr grammar, so people
can write org parsers/processors in other languages, and extend its
integration into other systems.
</li>
<li>
Org mode is fairly mature. Only the remaining inconsistencies should
be straightened out.
</li>
<li>
Hard to say, every so often I think of a feature that might be nice
to have. I have a feeling that alternate views (like the agenda) to
allow other ways of exploring your information would be handy, but I
have no concrete ideas yet as to what they might be.
</li>
<li>
Better exporting (for example better LaTeX export).   
</li>
<li>
The only thing I need is better integration with mh-e (I suspect it
is already there - just need to find the time to sort it out). Other
than that I am very content!
</li>
<li>
 I always wanted to be able to schedule a task for a specific week
(as oposed to a date) - I would like to improve the hipsterPDA
generation (export the agenda view as nice LaTeX, improve the
cal-tex output, etc)
</li>
<li>
Org grows faster than I can learn all those nice features. One
feature I'd love to see was that the HTML export created docs that
could be outlined like in an org buffer. I guess that's possible
with some CSS.
</li>
<li>
Task dependency for project planing
</li>
<li>
At the moment, I'm still on the learning curve. Org-mode has
soooooooooo many features I have not even discovered yet. I almost
daily open the manual pages to see I there is something I can use.
</li>
<li>
Probably, customization of built-in agenda view. But I'd rather see
org-mode streamlined and cleaned of unnecessary
complications. Properties should be either integrated more tightly
to replace tags/priorities/etc, or removed.
</li>
<li>
Looking forward to some of the dependency ideas.      
</li>
<li>
Import tasks from .ics files, include .ics files in agenda,
eventually include remote .ics files in agenda. Would like an
updated blogging tool that takes advantage of recent developments.
</li>
<li>
I'm working on integration with my email client and web browser --
it's a slow process because I'm not a programmer, but I'm learning
bits and pieces about bash shell scripts and grabbing what I can
from experts already using org.
</li>
<li>
I'd like a way to set project (outline item) dependencies and to
easily list those projects in dependency order. I could do it now
with properties, a dynamic block and some elisp. I'd use markup more
if it were more reliable in the emacs buffer. It might be nice to
have a mode where rigid outline style indenting is enforced while
editing outlines and lists. Perhaps as a buffer option or subtree
property. None of this is necessary or worth calling org-mode
immature.
</li>
<li>
Not new features. But perhaps splitting org.el into different
modules: one for outlining, one for doc format (Wiki engine), one
for GTD       
</li>
<li>
block quote text support. like wiki {{{ This is quote text }}}
Currently only putting ':' at beginning of text or heading.
</li>
<li>
I hope a better archive mechanism using C-c C-x C-c, which could
keep the structure in my org file.    
</li>
<li>
Seems mature; new features always interesting but can add a layer of
too-many-choices distraction. (See prioritizing problems above ;) )
</li>
<li>
New summary type {%} for progress status. Real comment syntax.        
</li>
<li>
I use only a fraction of its features.
</li>
<li>
Mature         

</li>

<h2 id="sec-7">6. Additional tutorials, documentation and screencasts would you like?</h2>


<p>
Original question:
Which topics or "how-to" guides would you like to see in the
documentation or as a tutorial or screencast?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
none. documentation is excellent
</li>
<li>
how to prepare/export/print GTD file to A7(index cards hPDA (hipster
PDA) forms
</li>
<li>
Everything should be a screencast for new users.      
</li>
<li>
I'd love to see more examples (with code) of how people use org,
especially for implementing GTD.
</li>
<li>
More detailed information about blogging would be great, especially
motivation for using org.
</li>
<li>
The manual and refcard usually have me covered. An in-depth
screencast on table/calc might be nice.       
</li>
<li>
More stuff about methodology to use it.       
</li>
<li>
Screencasts are most helpful to me. I would like to see material on
publishing and blogging in particular
</li>
<li>
Project lifecycle. Timesheet reports.
</li>
<li>
Exporting to other formats and customizing that
</li>
<li>
lot of screencast showing new features of org (such as one already
done)
</li>
<li>
The documentation is actually rather good as it is, haven't found
anything lacking yet. 
</li>
<li>
Integration with remember
</li>
<li>
Integrating org-mode with pine/alpine mailer. 
</li>
<li>
Not sure who you want to target. Advanced users are your bread and
butter and probably are OK. Beginners should get some screencasts
that describe a common problem and just focuses an how org mode can
help them. A good example is something like when someone's todo list
gets too long and complex and they want to split it, but maintain
connections between items on various lists, or perhaps view a
chronological list of all items in one location. Org mode is the
only program I know of the handles this kind of complexity
gracefully.
</li>
<li>
In depth explanation of using the agenda to its fullest
</li>
<li>
I'd love to see one on setting up column views. A tutorial on
publishing files would be great. And one about creating custom
agenda views. 
</li>
<li>
Changing the keybindings to make specific state transitions easier
to enter
</li>
<li>
don't know as of yet &hellip;      
</li>
<li>
using the spreadsheet with merged cells, calculation for rows and
columns - showing the true meaning of the properties stuff - over
all there should be examples - i really dislike the manual form
orgmode.org because it is technical oriented not for the simple
user - more howtos for gtd -&gt; learning from each other
</li>
<li>
Different usages of org-mode. From GTD to other ways &hellip;      
</li>
<li>
I find the manual well written and sufficient.
</li>
<li>
Use of drawers and properties.
</li>
<li>
HOw to organize multiple projects; auto-archival.
</li>
<li>
org spreadsheet       
</li>
<li>
Since Org-mode is (to me) a collection of "orthogonal" features, but
doesn't much impose structure, I'd be interested in seeing how
others organise their data and "bring it to life" with the Org-mode
features.
</li>
<li>
none
</li>
<li>
more documentation for org's lisp functions (in fact more examples
with org's lisp funtions!!)
</li>
<li>
remember mode integration
</li>
<li>
I prefer the documentation and experimentation. Need drives my
learning.
</li>
<li>
I don't have any preferences.
</li>
<li>
Can't think of any    
</li>
<li>
I think a new user would benefit from a screencast showing basic
hierarchy creation and navigation
</li>
<li>
Remember Practical uses of properties 
</li>
<li>
I would like to see more people to share their ways of using org
model
</li>
<li>
The documentation is already very good and it seems the manual is
never out of sync from the latest org-mode version. I found the
mailing list is the best source of "how-to" as people's individual
situations are so much different.
</li>
<li>
more of org for gtd
</li>
<li>
how to deal with the calendar and insert dates quickly - two-way
backends for groupware-like behavior - calender functionality for
scheduled events (receive popups or emails or sms or the like) -
probably more but it's too early to say
</li>
<li>
drawers + table calculations
</li>
<li>
Using org-mode as a calendar/planner. Perhaps a best practice around
where date- and time-stamps belong (in the headline? in a SCHEDULED:
property? DEADLINE: property?) Also, it would be helpful to be shown
the best practices around Categories (since they show up so
prominently in the agenda) I wanted them to be like David Allen's
"Contexts", but that's hard for me to manage. 
</li>
<li>
All the variables that you must configure to be able to write and
export an article successfully and without unexpected results - How
to move from {muse,kwiki,reST,planner,&hellip;} to org-mode: how to adapt
the syntax, &hellip;
</li>
<li>
examples of how to columns view
</li>
<li>
real examples of different ways of using org-mode
</li>
<li>
Scope projects? integrate Org into a software development
process/project? Handle &lt;not at computer&gt; org interactions?   
</li>
<li>
Daily use of agenda
</li>
<li>
I'm still not familiar with the more advanced features of org-mode,
so I'm keen to see these areas explored in tutorials and guides.
</li>
<li>
The spreadsheet.
</li>
<li>
None that I would be interested in, although I accept that new users
would benefit from them.
</li>
<li>
I think column-view is a great feature. Bastiens tutorial is good,
but I'm thinking a tutorial focused more on the use case as opposed
to the config option might be better. If I find time :-)
</li>
<li>
I don't know if it's just me, but currently I make no use of
tags. So any how-to or screencasts of how to use categories and tags
together in a senseful way would be nice. Most usages of tags I've
seen so far where tags like :phonecall: or :appoitment:, but when I
have a TODO "Call Jim" or "Meet Jim" those are superluous&hellip;  
</li>
<li>
I would welcome such how-to's and offer to help. The drawback of
screencasts is they take a long time, and there is no way a viewer
can tell it will be usefull to sit it all out. A guide giving
examples (and using short screencasts, if necessary) gives the
reader an overview, he/she can skip sections and browse to a
chapter/paragraph deemed usefull. I would like to learn howto tweak
my custom built todo-lists so that some of the statuses show up in
the agenda, and others don't. Example WRITE should be on the agenda,
but INVOICE not really. But the intermediate VERIFY should.
</li>
<li>
More on GTD. Agenda customization.
</li>
<li>
More on column mode and new uses of properties.
</li>
<li>
I know there are books and howtos about lisp, but it would be great
to see some smaller howtos that are specific to org applications,
and code samples.
</li>
<li>
The remember mode stuff scares me. I need to take some time learn
it. I also know agenda can do a lot more than I do with it. I'd like
to see screen shots of of column mode to drool over since I'm not
running emacs 22 yet. 
</li>
<li>
can't thing of any
</li>
<li>
Spreadsheet examples. 
</li>
<li>
how-to setup a gtd style system is always my favorite.        
</li>
<li>
Some experienced users' detailed explication of pros and cons of the
newer TMTOWTDI (There's More Than One Way To Do It) choices like
archiving methods, task states, etc. leading to &ndash; you
guessed it &ndash; prioritizing problems
</li>
<li>
Building complex agenda views.
</li>
<li>
Dunno.

<h2 id="sec-11">10. Are there any other comments you would like to make about org-mode?</h2>


<ul>
<li>
Thanks for this great software, I've waited for years for such a
tool. I've wrote some tools around org in Perl, hopefully I'll find
some time to contribute. Thanx a lot
</li>
<li>
Great tool to stay even longer in emacs OS :-)
</li>
<li>
Thanks!
</li>
<li>
Great App, Great Support, Great Community
</li>
<li>
org-mode is all-the-way cool.
</li>
<li>
With the possible exception of Emacs itself, org-mode is my very
favorite bit of software. It has inspired me to learn LISP, so I'm
looking forward to contributing in the near future.
</li>
<li>
It's fantastic and the maintainership and community are both second
to none!
</li>
<li>
Later. :)     
</li>
<li>
Great mode and very useful. Thanks a lot for your effort and time!
</li>
<li>
Great Work ! Felicitation to its author
</li>
<li>
It's indispensable for my current work and lifestyle.
</li>
<li>
It is a great package, thanks for making it available and keeping
it alive!
</li>
<li>
Thanks for the org-mode. I just love it! Do all my personal and job
planning with it!
</li>
<li>
Great tool, thanks thanks thanks :)
</li>
<li>
It's fantastic &ndash; thanks for the great tool. I'm getting older and
it's the only way I can "remember" everything. It's not just a great
todo list manager, but I use it to document almost everything about
my job (e.g. my original intentions about a
project/implementation). I can bury a TODO right down in the place
where I have most of the surrounding documentation.
</li>
<li>
I cannot overstate how valuable this mode is. It single handedly has
the potential to make laypeople aware of Emacs. Thanks so much for
working on it!
</li>
<li>
Love it. Love it. Love it. Carsten is awesome.
</li>
<li>
It's changing very fast, and I'm worried that my muscle memory will
start to fight against the changes. Still, it's good to see an Emacs
package with such active interest and support.        
</li>
<li>
I'm a happy user. Thanks to Carten and all contributors
</li>
<li>
great guys on the mailinglist, great spirit, excellent product :-)
</li>
<li>
Carsten, many thanks for this great piece of software! Keep it
simple and usuable - not everybody follows the power user discussion
in gmane
</li>
<li>
Keep up the great work! :)
</li>
<li>
Thanks to Carsten and to people on emacs-orgmode !!
</li>
<li>
Been a user of GNU Emacs for the last 18years, never seen such a
fascinating major mode. I like this kind of apps since I work in
knowledge organization, and would like to contribute in some
way. Our lab gnowledge.org would like to develop a java applet that
provides org mode kind of editing. The buffer thus produced will be
converted into html when the page is being served in the
background. This will encourage the community to do structured
documentation. Our lab is now engaged in developing
beta.selfplatform.eu, where in we would like to provide this
feature. Do you think, orgmode developers would like to help us or
contribute in this endeavor. Orgmode can be very useful for
furthering semantic computing.
</li>
<li>
It is a great product. I does not need to grow. It might risk
feature creep.
</li>
<li>
Excellent package
</li>
<li>
Thank you, Carsten!
</li>
<li>
Has increased my productivity a lot!
</li>
<li>
Really a great thank to the author "Carsten Dominik", "chapeau" as
they say in France!!!!
</li>
<li>
Org-mode was relatively immature when I started using it, and I have
kept with it for 2 simple reasons: 1. The maintainer (Carsten) is
friendly, fast, accurate, and thorough 2. It works &ndash; it does what
it claims to do, and does it well
</li>
<li>
Org mode keeps me organized, it's outstanding!
</li>
<li>
hmmh, org-mode is the first thing I start in the morning and the
last I close in the evening, I guess this tells it all.
</li>
<li>
Org mode has been an incredibly useful tool that is fun to use. I
think a main reason for its utility is that basic use requires
little thought. When I'm using it for brainstorming, it's almost
like I'm not aware that I'm using any program &ndash; I'm just
thinking. Any changes to org-mode should preserve this
simplicity. Thanks a ton to Carsten and all the others who have
contributed to this great project!
</li>
<li>
Thank you Carsten!
</li>
<li>
Maybe we should consider a separate package or maintainer for
xemacs&hellip;.    
</li>
<li>
Thanks, thanks and thanks.
</li>
<li>
Good stuff. thanks    
</li>
<li>
It's Fun. ASCII is usually the only interface I can get used to,
because it's so fast.
</li>
<li>
org-mode makes me look organised (though a bit quirky). That's
enough reason to use it.
</li>
<li>
Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-)   
</li>
<li>
Even if org-mode stands right where it is, it has been enormously
helpful. Thank you very, very much.
</li>
<li>
Well done     
</li>
<li>
Yes: org-mode progresses very well and improves with each version
</li>
<li>
for me its the greatest found treasure since I "dicovered" Emacs.
</li>
<li>
Great work! Wish I had time to contribute more.
</li>
<li>
Keep up the good work :)
</li>
<li>
It's a great software project and community. Thanks again to
everyone involved!
</li>
<li>
Excellent piece of software!
</li>
<li>
I'm very very happy with it.
</li>
<li>
org-mode is fantastic :-)
</li>
<li>
The best feature of Org are its two maintainers Carsten and Bastien
and its helpful community.
</li>
<li>
Great mode for emacs. I wish I was using it more      
</li>
<li>
It is great tool. Uncluttered. Thanks to Carsten et al.
</li>
<li>
Rock on!
</li>
<li>
favorite piece of software I use.
</li>
<li>
I'm continually amazed by what org can do, and also by how intuitive
it is. It's not at all unusual that I find myself thinking that it
would be great if org/emacs did "x", trying what seems to me to be
the way that it would do "x" if it could, and discovering that it
functions just as I expect. And when it doesn't, there are ways to
figure it out. (And Carsten is a great developer who shines at
hearing what his users are doing, responding to expressed needs, and
even being clear if/when he decides not to do what someone would
like him to do. Other heavy users and scripters are great as well.
</li>
<li>
I started using Org-mode as an outliner. It is the best outliner
I've used an much more. The community is valuable but Carsten's
skill and judgment has made org-mode what it is.
</li>
<li>
It's a killer tool that I could not live without.
</li>
<li>
org-mode is great, I hope it can keep clean text file when adding
functions.
</li>
<li>
I forced myself to learn emacs after 25+ years in the vi camp in
order to use org-mode. Loving it. Carsten's enthusiasm and support
are a joy, and the mailing list is always refreshing.
</li>
<li>
I plan to run a website where users could share Org files and edit
them together. I plan to write a better exporter (and more formats!)
I think the Org syntax is mature enough to get more programs
interacting with it outside Emacs. Org is <b>great</b> :)
</li>
<li>
It's wonderful. Thanks!
</li>
<li>
org-mode is a fantastic program, supported by a lively helpful email
list. Carsten is very responsive to feature requests and helping.
