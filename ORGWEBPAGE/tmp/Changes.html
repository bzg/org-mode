<h4>Remember/Refile/Goto</h4>


<ul>
<li>
The use of prefix arguments for the commands `org-remember'
and `org-refile' has been normalized:

<ul>
<li>
when called without prefix argument, the command does its
normal job, starting a remember note or refiling a tree.

</li>
<li>
when called with a single C-u prefix, these commands can be
used to select a target location and to jump there.  In
the case of `org-remember', you will be prompted for a
template and then Emacs jumps to the default target
location or this template.  In the case of `org-refile',
you select a location from the refile target list and jump
there.

</li>
<li>
when called with two prefixes (`C-u C-u'), the command
jumps to the location last used for storing a note or a
moved tree.

</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
When the clock is running inside an remember buffer, storing
the remember buffer with `C-c C-c' will automatically clock
out.  This was inspired by a request by Rainer Stengle. 

</li>
<li>
The variable `org-remember-use-refile-when-interactive'
introduced only in 5.19 is already obsolete.  Please use
`org-remember-interactive-interface' instead.  This new
variable does select the interface that is used to select
the target for a remember note in an interactive way.
Possible values are:

<ul>
<li>
`outline': Use an outline of the document to select a
location.  
</li>
<li>
`outline-path-completion': Use completion of an outline
path to select a location.
</li>
<li>
`refile': Offer the `org-refile-targets' as possible
targets.

</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
It is no longer necessary to update the refiling targets -
they are always current.

</li>
<li>
In `org-goto', typing characters now automatically starts
isearch from the beginning of the buffer.  The isearch is
special also because it only matches in headline.  This
goes some way toward saving org-goto from being removed
from Org-mode.  Thanks to Piotr Zielinski for the code, and
sorry that it took me so long to put it in.  If you prefer
to use single letters n,p,f,b,u,q for navigation as before,
configure the variable `org-goto-auto-isearch'.

</li>
<li>
Outline-path-completion is now available as an alternative
interface in the command `org-goto'.  Please select the
default interface you'd like to use with the new variable
`org-goto-interface'.  You can then select the alternative
interface with a prefix argument to `C-c C-j' (org-goto).  I
am considering to make outline-path-completion the default
interface.  Comments?


</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-4">
<h4>Misc</h4>


<ul>
<li>
Checkboxes now work hierarchically.  When a plain-list item
with a checkbox has children with checkboxes, the status of
the item's checkbox is calculated from the children, each
time a checkbox is toggled with C-c C-c.  Thanks to Miguel
A. Figueroa-Villanueva for a patch to this effect.

</li>
<li>
There is a new variable `org-special-ctrl-k'.  When set,
`C-k' will behave specially in headlines:

<ul>
<li>
When the cursor is at the beginning of a headline, kill
the entire line and possible the folded subtree below the
line.
</li>
<li>
When in the middle of the headline text, kill the
headline up to the tags.
</li>
<li>
When after the headline text, kill the tags.

</li>
</ul>
<p>This is following a proposal by Piotr Zielinski.
</p>
</li>
<li>
You can now also have a plain (as opposed to deadline or
scheduled) repeater timestamp in a task.  Switching the task
to DONE will now also shift a plain time stamp.  This was a
request by Austin Frank.

</li>
<li>
If an entry is clocked multiple times, it will now show up
several times in the agenda and timeline buffers, when
log-mode is on.  This was a proposal by Jurgen Defurne.

</li>
<li>
The clock table accepts a new parameter <code>:step</code>.  This
parameter can be `day' or `week' and will result in separate
tables for each day or week in the requested time interval.
This was triggered by a proposal by Sacha Chua in her <a href="http://sachachua.com/wp/2007/12/30/clocking-time-with-emacs-org/">blog</a>.

</li>
<li>
A time-stamp with a repeater now no longer refers to the
date <b>closest</b> to the current day.  Instead, it means either
today or the most recent match.  This change makes sure that
overdue scheduled or deadline items never disappear from the
agenda.  With the previous convention, an overdue scheduled
item would disappear.  For example, a weekly item scheduled
for Sunday would appear as overdue until Wednesday, and the
suddenly disappear until next Sunday.  Now the item will
show up as "Sched 7x" on Saturday.  From Sunday on it will
be in the list as "Scheduled", i.e. old sins will be
forgiven.  This follows a request by Warong, Dennis and
Bernt.

</li>
<li>
Archiving a subtree now creates an additional property,
<code>ARCHIVE_OLPATH</code>.  This property contains the "path" in the
outline tree to the archived entry, as it was in the
original file.  For example, archiving <code>Fix the door</code> in the
following hierarchy

<p>
<pre>
 * Tasks
 ** HOME
 *** Garage
 **** Fix the door
</pre>
</p>
<p>
will file is with the following property
</p>
<p>
<pre>
 :ARCHIVE_PATH: Task/HOME/Garage
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Note that you can configure (i.e. limit) the information
that gets stored upon archiving with the variable
`org-archive-save-context-info'.
</p>
</li>
<li>
New file `org-mac-message.el' by John Wiegley to create
links for messages in Apple Mail, and to follow these
links.

</li>
<li>
Bug fixes.

<h2>Version 5.19</h2>



<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Overview</h3>


<ul>
<li>
Column view can list the clocked times of a subtree.

</li>
<li>
Storing remember notes can use the `org-refile' interface.

</li>
<li>
Storing remember notes no longer produced empty lines.

</li>
<li>
Moving subtrees now folds all siblings of the subtree.

</li>
<li>
New variable `org-agenda-todo-keyword-format'.

</li>
<li>
Hack to allow brackets in link descriptions.

</li>
<li>
Clocking into an entry can enforce a specific TODO state.

</li>
<li>
EXPORT_FILE_NAME may be an absolute file name with "~".

</li>
<li>
Bug fixes, lots of them.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li>
A new special column definition lists the sum of all CLOCK
entries in a subtree.  For example

<p>
<pre>
 #+COLUMNS: %20ITEM %10Time_Estimate{:} %CLOCKSUM
</pre>
</p>
<p>
will allow you to compare estimated times (as given in the
Time_Estimate property) with the clocked times.  This was a
request by Bernt Hansen.
</p>
</li>
<li>
Storing remember notes can now use the `org-refile'
interface instead of the `org-goto' interface (see the
variable `org-remember-use-refile-when-interactive').
Nothing will change if the note is stored immediately after
pressing `C-c C-c' in the <code>*Remember*</code> buffer.  But if you
have chosen (e.g. by pressing `C-u C-c C-c') to
interactively select the filing location (file and
headline), the refile interface will be used instead.  I am
excited about this change, because the `org-goto' interface
is basically a failure, at least for this application.  Note
that in any case the refile interface has to be configured
first by customizing `org-refile-targets'.

</li>
<li>
Notes inserted with remember now remove any whitespace
before and after the note before being pasted, so that there
will be no empty lines inserted together with the note.  We
could invent special syntax in remember templates to allow
creating empty lines before a note - is there anyone who'd
want this?

</li>
<li>
Moving subtrees now folds all siblings of the subtree.  This
is the only reasonably simple way I could find to avoid the
reported inconsistencies in the folding state of the outline
tree after moving entries.  There are reasons to like this
new behavior, because it easily visualizes where the tree is
located after the move.  Still, not everyone might be happy
with this.  Massive complaining would be needed to make me
fix this.

</li>
<li>
New variable `org-agenda-todo-keyword-format' to specify the
width of the TODO keyword field in the agenda display.  Use
it to get things to line up better.  This was a proposal by
Rainer Stengele.

</li>
<li>
If a link description inserted with `C-c C-l' contains
brackets, the brackets will now be converted into curly
braces.  This looks similar enough.  Supporting brackets in
link descriptions is, for technical reasons too long to
explain here, complex.

</li>
<li>
The new option `org-clock-in-switch-to-state' can be set to
a TODO state that will be enforced when the clock is started
on an entry.  This follows an idea by Sacha Chua.

</li>
<li>
The EXPORT_FILE_NAME property may now also be an absolute
file name, and it may contain abbreviations like "~" for the
users home directory.  This was requested by Adam Spiers.

</li>
<li>
Bug fixes, lots of them.

<h2>Version 5.17</h2>



<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Details</h3>



<div class="outline-4">
<h4>Whitespace</h4>


<ul>
<li>
When cutting, pasting, or moving subtrees and items, the
empty lines <b>before</b> the subtree/item now belong to the
part and will be moved with it.  There is one exception to
this rule: If the first child is moved down (or,
equivalently, the second is moved up), the amount of empty
lines <b>above</b> the first child to be moved along with it is
limited by the number of empty lines <b>below</b> it.  This
sounds complicated, but it allows to have extra empty space
before the first child and still have good behavior of the
subtree motion commands.

</li>
<li>
Plain lists items work the same.

</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe we have finally nailed this one.  Thanks to Daniel
Pittman for bring this up again and to Eric Schulte for
pointing out that it is the empty lines <b>before</b> an entry
that really count.
</p>
<p>
This change was non-trivial, please give it a good test and
let me know about any problems.
</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-4">
<h4>Remember</h4>


<ul>
<li>
The new command `org-remember-goto-last-stored' will jump
to the location of the remember note stored most recently.
If you have `org-remember' on a key like `C-c r', then you
can go to the location with a double prefix arg: `C-u C-u
C-c r'.  This was a proposal by Rainer Stengele.

</li>
<li>
Template items that are being prompted for can now specify
a default value and a completion table.  Furthermore,
previous inputs at a specific prompt are captured in a
history variable.  For example:

<p>
<pre>
 %^{Author|Roald Dahl|Thomas Mann|Larry Niven}
</pre>
</p>
<p>
will prompt for an author name.  Pressing RET without
typing anything will select "Roald Dahl".  Completion will
give you any of the three names.  And a history will be
kept, so you can use the arrow keys to get to previous
input.  The history is tied to the prompt.  By using the
same prompt in different templates, you can build a history
across templates.  The ideas for this came from proposals
by Bastien and Adam.
</p>
</li>
<li>
When a remember template contains the string `%!', the note
will be stored immediately after all template parts have
been filled in, so you don't even have to press `C-c
C-c'. The was a proposal by Adam Spiers.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-4">
<h4>Refile</h4>


<ul>
<li>
`org-refile-targets' has a new parameter to specify a
maximum level for target selection.  Thanks to Wanrong Lin
for this proposal.

</li>
<li>
When the new option `org-refile-use-outline-path' is set,
refile targets will be presented like a file path to the
completion interface: "level 1/level 2/level 3".  This
may be the fastest interface yet to get to a certain
outline entry.  Do we need to use this interface in other
places?  Thanks to Jose Ruiz for this proposal.

</ul></div>

<div class="outline-4">
<h4>Restriction lock on agenda scope</h4>


<p>
You can now permanently lock the agenda construction to a
certain scope, like a file or a subtree.  So instead of
pressing "&lt;" for each command in the agenda dispatcher, you
only once select a restriction scope.  All subsequent agenda
commands will than respect this restriction.  For example,
you can use this at work, to limit agendas to your work file
or tree, and at home to limit to the home file or tree.  Or
you can use it during the day in order to focus in on certain
projects.
</p>
<p>
You select a scope with the command `C-c C-x &lt;', which
restricts to the current subtree.  When called with a `C-u'
prefix, the restriction is to the current file.  You can also
make restrictions from the speedbar frame, see below.
</p>
<p>
When making a new restriction and an agenda window is
currently visible, it will immediately be updated to reflect
the new scope.  TO if you like you can display an agenda view
and then watch it change in various scopes.
</p>
<p>
To get rid of the restriction, use the command "C-c C-x &gt;".
Or press "&gt;" in the agenda dispatcher.  Also, and use of "&lt;"
in the dispatcher will disable the restriction lock and
select a new restriction.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to Rick Moynihan for triggering this development. 
</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-4">
<h4>Imenu and Speedbar support</h4>


<ul>
<li>
Org-mode now supports Imenu.  For example, with the setting

<p>
<pre>
 (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 
    (lambda () 'imenu-add-to-menubar "Imenu"))
</pre>
</p>
<p>
a menu will be created in each Org-mode buffer that
provides access to all level 1 and level 2 headings.  The
depth of the menu can be set with the variable
`org-imenu-depth'.
</p>
</li>
<li>
org-mode now supports Speedbar.  This means that you can
drill into the first and second level headlines of an
Org-mode file right from the speedbar frame.

</li>
<li>
You can set a restriction lock for the Org-mode agenda to a
file or a subtree directly from the speedbar frame.  Just
press "&lt;" with the cursor on an Org-mode file or subtree to
set the lock and immediately update the agenda if it is
visible.  Use "&gt;" to get rid of the lock again.

</li>
</ul></div>

<ul>
<li>
There are new special properties TIMESTAMP and TIMESTAMP_IA.
These can be used to access the first keyword-less active

</li>
<li>
New variable `org-clock-heading-function'.  It can be set to
a function that creates the string shown in the mode line

<h3>Incompatible changes</h3>


<ul>
<li>
If you have customized the variable `org-emphasis-alist' or
org-export-emphasis-alist', you need to do it again by first
canceling your customization and then adding it again.

</li>
<li>
I know that some people have defined their own private helper
functions to select a specific remember template, without being
prompted, like this:

<p>
<pre>
 (defun my-remember-template-n ()
    (interactive)
    (org-remember ?n))
</pre>
</p>
<p>
You need to modify this.  The character selecting the template
must now be the <i>second</i> argument to `org-remember':
</p>
<p>
<pre>
 (defun my-remember-template-n ()
    (interactive)
    (org-remember nil ?n))
</pre>
</p>
</li>

<div class="outline-3">

<div class="outline-4">
<h4>Remember and related stuff</h4>


<ul>
<li>
New command `org-refile' to quickly move a note to a
different place.  It is bound to `C-c C-w'.  The foremost
application might be to put a note or task captured with
`remember' into the proper list or project.  The command
offers a list of possible refiling targets for completion.
These are headings under which the entry will be inserted
as a subitem.  By default, this will offer all top-level
headings in the current buffer, but you can configure the
variable `org-refile-targets' to get more complex
definitions.  For example:

<p>
<pre>
 (setq org-refile-targets '((nil . (:level . 2))))
</pre>
</p>
<p>
selects all level 2 headlines in the current buffer as
targets.  And
</p>
<p>
<pre>
 (setq org-refile-targets
      '((org-agenda-files . (:tag . "refile"))))
</pre>
</p>
<p>
searches all agenda files and selects headlines that are
explicitly marked with the tag :refile: .  Note that the
list of targets is built upon first use only, to rebuilt
it, call the command `C-c C-w' with a double prefix
argument.
</p>
<p>
This is based on an idea and example implementation by Max
Mikhanosha.  Many thanks Max.
</p>
</li>
<li>
You can now use a C-u prefix on `org-remember' to jump to
the location where a specific templates stores its notes.
For example, if you have `org-remember' bound to `C-c r',
then `C-u C-c r n' will get you to the file and headline
given in the template associated with the letter "n".

<p>
This was proposed by someone, but I have lost track who.
Sorry, and thanks anyway.
</p>
</li>
<li>
New %-escapes in remember templates:

<p>
<pre>
 %c     insert the current clipboard, like C-y would do
 %(..)  evaluate Lisp expression and insert the result
 %[..]  include file
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Thanks to Adam Spiers and Tim O'Callaghan.
</p>
</li>
<li>
New function `org-remember-insinuate' that makes is easier
to set Org-mode specific values for remember variables.
Thanks to Michael Olson for this proposal.  It is
equivalent to:

<p>
<pre>
 (require 'remember)
 (setq remember-annotation-functions '(org-remember-annotation))
 (setq remember-handler-functions '(org-remember-handler))
 (add-hook 'remember-mode-hook 'org-remember-apply-template))
</pre>
</p>
<p>
You might still want to set `org-default-notes-file' to
provide a default for templates without a file, and
`org-directory' to show where to find other org files.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-4">
<h4>Emphasis and Font-lock stuff</h4>


<ul>
<li>
Stacked emphasis like */bold italic/* is no longer allowed.

</li>
<li>
You may finally emphasize a single character like *a*.

</li>
<li>
Font-lock now can hide the emphasis markers, just like Muse
does.  Configure the variable `org-hide-emphasis-markers'
if you want this.  Showing the characters continues to be
the default in Org-mode.

</li>
<li>
Text in the "=" emphasis is now exported verbatim, i.e. no
further parsing and interpretation of this text takes place.  So
you can write =quoted *xxx* a_x = b=.  This and the following
point implement a request by Daniel Clemente.

</li>
<li>
There is a new emphasis marker "~" which marks text to be
exported verbatim, without special formatting.  Inside an
org-mode file, this text is highlighted with the org-verbatim
face.  I am not happy with the face yet (currently is is like
org-code, but underlined), please suggest a better one.

</li>
<li>
Whether an emphasis environment is verbatim or not is now an
extra flag in the variable `org-emphasis-alist'.  If you have
configured this variable, do it again by first canceling your
customization to revert to the default, and then adding it
again.

</li>
<li>
New variable `org-highlight-latex-fragments-and-specials'.
When turned on, Org-mode will highlight all strings that
are treated in a special way by the exporters.  This is
great for export-oriented writing, but maybe a bit noisy
for note taking, so this feature is off by default.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-4">
<h4>Properties and Column view</h4>


<ul>
<li>
`org-use-property-inheritance' may now also be a list of
property names that should be treated with inheritance
during searches.

</li>
<li>
CATEGORY="work" can now be used in a tags/property search,
even if the category is not specified as a property in the
entry, but rather is inherited or derived from #+CATEGORY.
Thanks to Adam, Tim, and Bastien for an interesting
discussion around this issue.

</li>
<li>
Summary type improvements in column view.
<ul>
<li>
The {+} summary type can specify a printf-style output
format for computed values like this: {+;%5.2f}
This was triggered by a report by Levin.
</li>
<li>
New currency summary type {$}, which so far is just a
shorthand for {+;%.2f}.  Do we need to have a currency
symbol in front of each value.  Scott Jaderholm asked for
this, but I am not sure if this is already what he meant.

</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-4">
<h4>The date/time prompt</h4>


<p>
There have been several small but <b>very</b> useful additions to
the date prompt.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
While entering data at the date prompt, the current
interpretation of your input is shown next to your input in
the minibuffer.  I find this great to understand how the
input works.  If you find the extra stuff in the minibuffer
annoying, turn it off with `org-read-date-display-live'.

</li>
<li>
The date prompt now prefers to select the future.  If you
enter a date without a month, and the day number is before
today (for example, on the 16th of the month you enter
"9"), Org-mode will assume next month.  Similarly, if you
enter a month and no year, next year will be assumed if the
entered month is before the current, for example if you
enter "May" in September.  Thanks to John Rakestraw for
this great suggestion.  If you find it confusing, turn it
off with `org-read-date-prefer-future'.

</li>
<li>
When modifying an existing date using `C-c .' at the stamp,
the time or time range in the stamp are now offered as
default input at the prompt.  This goes a long way to
simplifying the modification of an existing date.  Thanks
to Adam Spiers for this proposal.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-4">
<h4>Export (all implemented by Bastien&hellip;)</h4>


<ul>
<li>
You can now export special strings in HTML.  Here is the
list of newly performed conversions:

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<col align="left"></col><col align="left"></col><col align="left"></col>
<thead>
<tr><th>Org</th><th>Description</th><th>HTML</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>\\-</td><td>double backslash followed by minus</td><td>&amp;shy;</td></tr>
<tr><td>--</td><td>two dashes (minuses)</td><td>&amp;ndash;</td></tr>
<tr><td>---</td><td>three dashes (minuses)</td><td>&amp;mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td>...</td><td>three dots</td><td>&amp;hellip;</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>
You can turn this globally on or off with
`org-export-with-special-strings' or locally with "-:t" or
"-:nil" in the #+OPTIONS line.  Thanks to Adam Spiers for
starting the discussion, and thanks to Daniel Clemente and
William Henney for relevant inputs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
Comma-separated emails in #+EMAIL: are correctly exported.
Thanks to Raman for pointing out this omission.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-4">
<h4>Agenda</h4>


<ul>
<li>
In the agenda, a few keys have changed
<pre>
 g  does now the same a "r", refresh current display,
    because "g" is the Emacs standard for "refresh"
 G  toggle the time grid, used to be "g"
 e  Execute another agenda command, pretty much the same as
    `C-c a', but shorter and keep the same agenda window.
</pre>

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-4">
<h4>Miscellaneous (much of it from Bastien)</h4>


<ul>
<li>
You can now select the sectioning structure of your LaTeX
export by setting it either globally
(`org-export-latex-default-class') or locally in each Org
file (with #+LaTeX_CLASS: myclass).  You can also customize
the list of available classes and their sectioning
structures through the new `org-export-latex-classes'
option.  Thanks to Daniel for discussions and suggestion on
this issue.

</li>
<li>
You can send and receive radio lists in HTML,
LaTeX or TeXInfo, just as you send and receive radio
tables.  Check the documentation for details and examples.

</li>
<li>
The default for `org-ellipsis' is back to nil, some people
seem to have had problems with the face as a default.

</li>
<li>
Support for pabbrev-mode, needs pabbrev version 1.1.  Thanks
to Phillip Lord for adapting his package to make this
possible.

</li>
<li>
New variable `org-show-entry-below' to force context-showing
commands to expose the body of a headline that is being
shown.  Thanks to Harald Weis for pointing out this omission.

<div class="outline-4">
<h4>Bug fixes and improvements in column view</h4>


<ul>
<li>
All the bugs described by Scott Jaderholm have been fixed
(at least I hope so&hellip;).

</li>
<li>
You can now capture a column view into a dynamic block, for
exporting or printing it.  The column view can be

<ul>
<li>
global, i.e. for the entire file
</li>
<li>
local, i.e. for the subtree where the dynamic block is
</li>
<li>
from an entry with a specific :ID: property.

</li>
</ul>
<p>You can identify the entry whose column view you want to
capture by assigning an :ID: property, and use that property
in the dynamic block definition.  For example:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
 * Planning
   :PROPERTIES:
     :ID: planning-overview
   :END:

 [...]

 * The column view
 #+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id "planning-overview"

 #+END:
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Use `C-c C-x r' to insert such a dynamic block, and you will
be prompted for the ID.
</p>
</li>
<li>
When the current column format displays TODO keyword,
priority or tags, these parts are stripped from the content
of the ITEM column, making for more compact and readable
entries.  When any of these "properties" are not listed in
the current column format, they are instead retained in the
ITEM column.

</li>
<li>
You can now also edit the ITEM column with `e'.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-4">
<h4>The agenda dispatcher</h4>


<ul>
<li>
Instead of pressing `1' to restrict an agenda command to
the current buffer, or `0' to restrict it to the current
subtree or region, you can now also press `&lt;' once or
twice, respectively.  This frees up `1' and `0' for user
commands, a request by Bastien.  In fact, "&lt;" cycles
through different restriction states.  "1" and "0" are
still available for backward compatibility, until you bind
them to custom commands.

</li>
<li>
The access code to custom agenda commands can now contain
several characters, effectively allowing to bundle several
similar commands into a sub-keymap.  This follows an
excellent proposal by Adam Spiers.  For example:

<p>
<pre>
 (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
   '(("h" . "HOME + Name tag searches") ; describe prefix "h"
     ("hl" tags "+HOME+Lisa")
     ("hp" tags "+HOME+Peter")
     ("hk" tags "+HOME+Kim")))
</pre>
</p>
</li>
<li>
The user function option in org-agenda-custom-commands may
now also be a lambda expression, following a request by
Adam Spiers.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-4">
<h4>Sorting improvements</h4>


<p>
We are using a new routine for sorting entries, courtesy of
John Wiegley.  Many thanks to John.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You can define your own function to extract a sorting key
and in this way sort entries by anything you like.

</li>
<li>
Entries can now be sorted according to the value of a
property.

</li>
<li>
Plain lists can be sorted.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-4">
<h4>HTML &lt;div&gt; structure</h4>


<p>
There is now a &lt;div&gt;-based structure in exported HTML.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The table of context is wrapped into a div with a class
"table-of-contents".

</li>
<li>
The outline structure is embedded in &lt;div&gt; elements with
classes "outline-1", "outline-2" etc.

</li>
<li>
The postamble, containing the author information and the
date is wrapped into a div with class "postamble".

</li>
</ul>
<p>I am not sure if the class names are the best choice, let me
know if there are more "canonical" choices.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to Mike Newman and Cezar for input, and in particular
to Mike for his clearly formulated specification.
</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-4">
<h4>Other stuff</h4>


<ul>
<li>
New variable `org-agenda-window-frame-fractions' to
customize the size limits of the agenda window in the case
that you display the agenda window by reorganizing the
frame.

</li>
<li>
Drawers can be set on a per-file basis using

<p>
<pre>
 #+DRAWERS: HIDDEN STATE PROPERTIES
</pre>
</p>
<p>
This will define the drawers :HIDDEN: and :STATE:.
The :PROPERTY: drawer should always be part of this list, or
your properties will not be folded away.
Thanks to Richard G. Riley for this proposal.
</p>
</li>
<li>
`org-agenda-fontify-priorities' may now also be an
association list of priorities and faces, to specify the
faces of priorities in the agenda individually.

</li>
<li>
The variable `org-export-with-property-drawer' no longer
exists, please use `org-export-with-drawers' instead.  Also,
the corresponding switch in the #+OPTIONS line has changed
from "p" to "d".  Thanks to Bastien for pointing out that we
needed to handle not only the property drawer.

</li>
<li>
M-up and M-down now move the current line up and down (if
not at a headline, item or table).  Among other things you
can use this to re-order properties in the drawer.  This was
a proposal by Bastien.

</li>
<li>
New variable `org-agenda-todo-ignore-with-date', based on a
request by Wanrong Lin.

</li>
<li>
Aborting remember template selection with C-g now kills the
remember buffer and restores the old window configuration.
This was a request by Nuutti Kotivuori.

</li>

<li>
`C-c /' now calls `org-sparse-tree'.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li>
Remember templates can now have a template name as the first
element.  The name will be listed along with the selection
character when prompting for a template.  It is best to have
the name start with the selection character, for example if
you use ("Note" "n"), you will be prompted like "[n]ote".
Thanks to Matiyam for this proposal.

</li>
<li>
`C-c C-k' will abort taking a note.  You can use this in remember
buffers and when taking a logging note (e.g. for a state
change).  Thanks to Bastien.

</li>
<li>
`C-c C-x C-w' and `C-c C-x M-w' now accept a prefix arg to
cut N sequential subtrees.  This was a proposal by John.

</li>
<li>
Lines in the agenda are now bold if they have priority A and
italic if they have priority C.  You can turn this off using
the variable `org-agenda-fontify-priorities'.  Thanks to
John Wiegley for the idea and code.

</li>
<li>
New variable `org-scheduled-past-days' to set the number a
scheduled item will be listed after its date has passed.
Default is 10000, i.e. indefinitely.

</li>
<li>
New variables `org-agenda-deadline-leaders' and
`org-agenda-scheduled-leaders' to adjust the leading text o
scheduled items and deadline in the agenda.  Thanks to John
Wiegley for a patch.

</li>
<li>
New sparse tree function `org-sparse-tree'.  This is now the
default binding for `C-c /'.  It requires one additional
keypress to select a command, but in return is provides a
single interface to all the different sparse tree commands,
with full completion support.

</li>
<li>
The variable `org-ellipsis' now defaults to the face
`org-link' because the visibility of the dots is really bad
and I have found this change very useful indeed.

</li>
<li>
The #+OPTIONS line has a new option "tags" which can be used
to set `org-export-with-tags'.  Thanks to Wanrong Lin for
this proposal.

</li>
<li>
New variable `org-use-property-inheritance'.  Configure it
to `t' if you want that searching for entries with certain
properties always should assume inheritance.  This is not
well tested yet, please check it out.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li>
The LOGGING property allows to modify the settings for
progress logging for a single entry.  For example:

<p>
<pre>
 :PROPERTIES:
   :LOGGING: nologging nologrepeat
 :END:
</pre>
</p>
<p>
turns off all progress logging for the current entry and its
children.
</p>
</li>
<li>
The properties SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION and LOCATION have
special meaning during iCalendar export, when they translate
to the corresponding VEVENT and VTODO fields.  If not given,
Org-ode continues to use cleaned-up version of the headline
and body as the summary and the description, respectively.

</li>
<li>
New function to go to the entry with the currently running
clock.  Bound to `C-c C-x C-j', in agenda also to "J".  If
you use this often, you might even want to assign a global
key.  Thanks to Bernt and Bastien.

</li>
<li>
Clock entries can now have their own drawer, the :CLOCK:
drawer.  Check out the variable `org-clock-into-drawer' for
configuration of this feature.  The default is to create a
drawer when the second clocking line gets added to an entry.
Note that "CLOCK" has been added to the default value of
`org-drawers', but if you have configured that variable, you
must go back and add "CLOCK" yourself to get this drawer
folded away.  Thanks to Tom Weissman for pointing out that
too many clock entries are visually annoying.

</li>
<li>
`C-c C-x C-r' no longer tries to find the first clocktable
in a buffer and then updates it.  Instead, it will update
the clocktable at point if there is one (same as C-c C-c
will do if the cursor is in the "#+BEGIN" line of the
table).  If there is none at point, a new one will be
inserted.  This change was necessary because the new :scope
parameter allows to have several clocktables in a buffer.
Thanks to Bastien for pointing this out.
To update all dynamic blocks in a file, use `C-u C-c C-x C-u'.

</li>
<li>
The function `org-remember' can now be called with a
template selection key as argument.  This helps to make key
bindings that go directly to a specific template without
being prompted for a template, like this:

<p>
<pre>
 (global-set-key [f5] (lambda () (interactive) (org-remember "j")))
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Thanks to Richard G Riley for bringing this up.
</p>
</li>
<li>
`C-n' and `C-p' are back to their default binding
(next/previous line) in the agenda buffer.  Enough people,
including recently Denis Bueno, have complained about this,
and I agree it is not good to break habits like that.

</li>
<li>
`C-x C-s' in an agenda buffer now saves all org-mode buffers
(also `s' does this).

</li>
<li>
Setting schedule or deadline dates from the agenda now
produces a note in the agenda, similarly to what happens
with S-left/right.

</li>
<li>
Using a prefix argument for `C-c C-d' or `C-c C-s' will
remove the deadline or scheduling date from an item.  Thanks
to Wanrong Lin for this proposal.

</li>
<li>
New variable `org-agenda-compact-blocks'.  When set, the
space between blocks in a block agenda is reduced as much as
possible, to show more items on a single screen.

</li>
<li>
The variable `org-agenda-tags-column' (renamed from
`org-agenda-align-tags-to-column') can now also be negative,
to mean alignment to the left.  The new default is -80, just
like it is now for `org-tags-column'.

<h2>Version 5.10</h2>

Bug fixes.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li>
Both the category and the archive location in a (sub)tree of
the buffer can now be specified using a property, for
example:

<p>
<pre>
 * Tree with special properties
   :PROPERTIES:
     :CATEGORY: Examples
     :ARCHIVE:  /some/special/file::
   :END:
</pre>
</p>
<p>
This is a much cleaner way of dealing with multiple
categories and archives in a single file.  The preferred use
of the <code>#+CATEGORY</code> and <code>#+ARCHIVE</code> lines is now to set a
<b>single</b> default for the file which is then locally
overruled by properties.  This was a proposal from Bastien
if I remember correctly.  Multiple <code>#+</code> lines still work
and I don't plan to remove this support soon, but I
encourage you to stop using them.
</p>
</li>
<li>
The clocktable has a new <code>:scope</code> parameter that determines
the range in the file from which clock entries should be
taken.  This can be anything from the local subtree to the
entire buffer to even the full list of agenda files.  Legal
values are:

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<col align="left"></col><col align="left"></col>
<thead>
<tr><th>value</th><th>scope</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>nil</td><td>the current buffer or narrowed region</td></tr>
<tr><td>file</td><td>the full current buffer</td></tr>
<tr><td>subtree</td><td>the subtree where the clocktable is located</td></tr>
<tr><td>treeN</td><td>the surrounding level N tree, for example tree3</td></tr>
<tr><td>tree</td><td>the surrounding level 1 tree</td></tr>
<tr><td>agenda</td><td>all agenda files</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>
Thanks to Jason F. McBrayer and Bernt Hansen for
inspiration.  Thanks to cranreuch (what is you full name?)
for mentioning, at the right moment, that the clocktable is
not so bad - that remark made it seem worthwhile to add
features.
</p>
</li>
<li>
The commands to import a table and to convert a region to a
table can now handle comma-separated values (CSV).  The
algorithm does not yet treat quoting correctly, but for
basic input it works.

</li>
<li>
When modifying an existing time stamp, or when entering the
second stamp of a range, the date prompt will now
consistently default to the date/time in the existing stamp.
This was triggered by Nuutti Kotivuori's request.

</li>
<li>
At the date/time prompt, there is a new way to specify a
range of hours, by using "+DURATION" after the time.  For
example:

<p>
<pre>
  14:00+2  means 14:00-16:00
  2pm+2:30 means 14:00-16:30
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Again, Nuutti Kotivuori's request.
</p>
</li>
<li>
When you use the function `turn-on-orgstruct++' to turn on
orgstruct-mode, the special org-mode settings for
auto-filling, indentation and paragraphs are exported into
the buffer, so that typing list items with indentation works
better.  This was Bastien's idea and request.

</li>
<li>
New variable `org-priority-start-cycle-with-default'.  When
t (the default), priority cycling will initially set the
default priority and then increase or decrease.  When nil,
the first priority set by cycling is already 1 different
from the default priority.  This was mostly driven by
Bastien.

</li>
<li>
In column view: When an entry has a property for a summary
column defined, its value is normally overwritten by the sum
of all the children's values each time you enter column
view.  Now there is an exception to this rule: If none of
the children has that particular property defined, the
parent's value stays.  In this way you can still place TODO
items under such an entry without getting the property value
changed.  Thanks to Russel Adams for pointing out that this
is a better way of doing things.

</li>
<li>
In column view, computed values are now bold face, and
trying to edit them is an error.  I think this works, but
testing is appreciated.

</li>
<li>
New command `org-occur-in-agenda-files', this is basically
the quick command John Wiegley proposed the other day, but
it also works when the agenda files are not yet in buffers.
The key is `C-c C-x /', any better proposals?

</li>
<li>
Links containing a space will now be handled correctly when
calling the browser.  Note that you need to enclose such
links in square or angular brackets.

</li>
<li>
Bug fixes.

<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Overview</h3>


<ul>

Taking a note upon TODO state changes can be restricted to
selected states.

</li>
<li>
The format in which dates are shown in the daily/weekly
agenda can be configured.

</li>
<li>
The default for `org-remember-store-without-prompt' is now t.

</li>
<li>
`org-goto' has been made into a general lookup command.

</li>
<li>
Priority cycling goes back to the nil state.

</li>
<li>
You can store a remember note to the <b>last used</b> location.

</li>
<li>
On Emacs 23, the headline faces for org-mode are now
inherited from the outline faces.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Incompatible Changes</h3>


<ul>
<li>
The default for `org-remember-store-without-prompt' is now
t, in order to better match the original intent of
remember.el (storing a note with minimum interruption of
work flow).  I expect that many people will be hit by this
incompatible change - nevertheless I believe it is the right
thing to do.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li>
You can now select specific states for recording a note when
switching to that state.  With the setting

<p>
<pre>
 #+SEQ_TODO: TODO(t) ORDERED(o@) INVOICE(i@) PAYED(p) | RECEIVED(r)
 #+STARTUP: lognotestate
</pre>
</p>
<p>
only the states ORDERED and INVOICE will record a timestamp
and a note.
</p>
</li>
<li>
You can now set the format of the string for each day in the
agenda and timeline buffers.  You can use a format string
interpreted by `format-time-string', or you can write your
own function.  Configure the new variable
`org-agenda-format-date'.  Thanks to Levin for triggering
this development with a patch.

</li>
<li>
The default for `org-remember-store-without-prompt' is now
t, in order to better match the original intent of
remember.el (storing a note with minimum interruption of
work flow).  Since we can assign files and headlines to
templates, I guess this takes care of selecting a filing
location in most cases.  For interactive filing, you now
need a prefix command when exiting `remember'.

</li>
<li>
`org-goto' (bound to `C-c C-j') now uses an indirect buffer
and has additional commands enabled: Org-occur with `C-c /'
or even faster with `/', and the commands needed to select
and copy a region.  This make `org-goto' a more general
lookup command instead of only a jumping command.  Remember
that you can exit with `Q' to go back to the original
location.  Thanks to William Henney for this idea.

</li>
<li>
Setting the priority with S-up/down now cycles back to a
state where no priority is specified.  This was requested by
Rick Moynihan.

</li>
<li>
You can store a remember note to the <b>last used</b> location.
So if you select a location interactively once, you can
re-use it without having to find it again.  For this, exit
the remember buffer with `C-u C-u C-c C-c'.  The leading
comment in the remember buffer will tell exactly where the
note goes if you exit with a particular command.
Thanks to Maxim Loginov for this idea.

</li>
<li>
On Emacs 23, the headline faces for org-mode are now
inherited from the outline faces.  This is just a
convenience, so that you only have to configure one set of
faces, and that will then be outline-1 .. outline-8.  You
will actually not see any difference in org-mode, because
Stefan Monnier has made the outline faces in Emacs 23 to
match the current org-mode faces.

<p>
This change does not effect XEmacs, nor Emacs 21 and 22.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-2">
<h2>Version 5.08</h2>



<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Incompatible changes</h3>


<ul>
<li>
The default for `org-deadline-warning-days' is now 14.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li>
There is now a separate interface for fast and directly
setting a TODO keyword.  This interface kicks in when you
have configured keys for TODO keywords like

<p>
<pre>
 #+SEQ_TODO: TODO(t) WAITING(w) | DONE(d) CANCELED(c)
</pre>
</p>
<p>
C-c C-t still does the cycling thing, you need to use a
prefix argument to get to the fast interface.  Or configure
the variable `org-use-fast-todo-selection' to t, then this
will be the default and the prefix argument will make the
command fall back to cycling.
</p>
<p>
The tag selection no longer does include TODO keywords -
Leo's arguments have convinced me that this is not a good
idea.  If you'd like to see the TODO keywords in the tags
interface anyway, set the variable
`org-fast-tag-selection-include-todo'.  Thanks to Leo and
others for input on this issue.
</p>
</li>
<li>
New variable `org-edit-timestamp-down-means-later'.  When
set, `S-down' on a timestamp will change the timestamp to
later.  Thanks to Raman for this idea.

</li>
<li>
Property names can now contain non-ascii word characters.
This follows a request from Daniel Clemente.

</li>
<li>
For export, the date that should be given in the exported
file can now be set to a specific value with a line like

<p>
<pre>
 #+DATE: 15 November 2003
</pre>
</p>
<p>
If you want to use the date/time when the file was created,
use a format string that will be interpreted by
`format-time-string', for example:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
 #+DATE: %Y/%m/%d %X
</pre>
</p>
</li>
<li>
The default of `org-deadline-warning-days' has changed to 14
days.  30 was really too much, I suspect most people (me
included) have changed this.

</li>
<li>
When a deadline has an individual lead time, this lead time
obviously overrules `org-deadline-warning-days'.  However,
if you bind `org-deadline-warning-days' to a number &lt;=0, for
example during a custom agenda command, then the absolute
value of this number will be enforced also when a different
lead time has been specified.  This is useful to get a list
of all deadlines coming up in the next N days.

</li>
</ul></div>

<h2>Version 5.07</h2>



<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Overview</h3>


<ul>
<li>
Different faces for different TODO keywords.

</li>
<li>
Setting TODO states through the TAG setting interface.

</li>
<li>
Context information is stored when moving a tree to the archive.

</li>
<li>
Sorting can be done by priority.

</li>
<li>
`Org-ellipsis' can now also be a face.

</li>
<li>
Scheduling info is no longer removed entry is marked CLOSED.

</li>
<li>
Unavailable files in `org-agenda-files' can be skipped.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Incompatible changes</h3>


<ul>
<li>
The time of archiving is now stored as a property.
ARCHIVED is no longer a special time keyword.

</li>
<li>
Scheduling info is no longer removed entry is marked CLOSED.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li>
You can now define different faces for different TODO
keywords.  This request has come up frequently, so here it
is: Use the variable `org-todo-keyword-faces'.

<p>
A Here is a configuration example:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
 (setq org-todo-keyword-faces
   '(("TODO"      . org-warning)
     ("DEFERRED"  . shadow)
     ("CANCELED"  . (:foreground "blue" :weight bold
                    :underline t))))
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Org-mode continue still use `org-todo' and `org-done' for
keywords that have no specific face assigned.
</p>
</li>
<li>
Some People use TODO states more like tags.  For them the
TODO keywords mark special states and they like to quickly
switch between states in arbitrary sequence.  The standard
TODO interface is not perfect for this, because it assumes
that the states are reached in sequence.  However, the fast
tag setting interface is in fact perfect for this.  You can
now "misuse" the TAG selection interface to also set TODO
states.  All you need to do is to assign keys to the TODO
states, just like you also do for tags.

<p>
<pre>
 #+SEQ_TODO: TODO(t) WAITING(w) | CANCELED(c) DONE(d)
 #+TAGS: @HOME(h) @OFFICE(o) @SHOP(s)
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Next time you try to set tags with C-c C-c, the todo states
will be offered as well, and the corresponding key will
switch the entry to that state.
</p>
</li>
<li>
New variable `org-archive-save-context-info' governs if
information that would be lost by moving a subtree to the
archive file, should be stored as special properties.  For
example,

<p>
<pre>
 (setq org-archive-save-context-info '(itags category))
</pre>
</p>
<p>
will store the inherited tags and the category in properties
ARCHIVE_ITAGS and ARCHIVE_CATEGORY, respectively.  The
default setting for this variable is to save everything that
could be lost.  This was a proposal by John Wiegley.
</p>
</li>
<li>
Sorting (`C-c ^') can use the use the priority to sort.  Use
the "p" and "P" keys at the prompt.  John Wiegley, again.

</li>
<li>
`Org-ellipsis' can now also be a face to make the folding
ellipsis more visible.  This is based on a post by Tassilo
Horn.  Since `org-ellipsis' only works in Org-mode, you
might want to use Tassilo Horn's hack directly in order to
affect the folding ellipsis globally.

</li>
<li>
Scheduling info is no longer removed when an entry is marked
CLOSED.  This was a request by Brian van den Broek.  Let me
know if this breaks anything for you - then it will become
an option.

</li>
<li>
New option `org-agenda-skip-unavailable-files'.  Currently,
if a file does not exist, it will be removed from
`org-agenda-files' after a query.  When this option is set,
the file will simply be skipped.

</li>
<li>
Bug fixes.

<h2>Version 5.06</h2>



<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Overview</h3>


</div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li>
When exporting only a region and this region is a single
(sub)tree (for example selected with `C-c @'), the title for
the exported document is taken to be the heading of the
subtree.  The sublevels become top-level entries in the
export.  Furthermore, if the head entry of the tree has or
inherits an EXPORT_FILE_NAME property, that file name (with
appropriately substituted extension) will be used for the
exported tree.  Thanks to Patrick Drechsler and Jost Burkart
for these ideas.

</li>
<li>
org-special-ctrl-a/e has a third allowed value, `reversed'.
When it is set to this value, the first C-a or C-e command
behaves normally, i.e. it goes to the true beginning or end
of the line.  Only when you press C-a or C-e immediately
again, the the "special" position will be found.  Additional
presses of the same key jump between the two positions.  I
like this a lot better than the `t' setting, because now the
keys behave more predictable and still give easy access to
the special locations.

</li>
<li>
New command to set or remove a tag from all headlines in a
region.

</li>
<li>
When Org-mode visits a file, it will initially hide all
drawers.

</li>
<li>
The default of the variable `org-cycle-global-at-bob' is now
nil, meaning that TAB no longer does global visibility
cycling at the beginning of the buffer.

</li>
<li>
Bug fixes, in particular the problems with scheduling and
deadlines introduced in 5.05.  Please check carefully if
this works correctly again, and complain if not.

<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li>
Bastien's `org-export-latex.el' is now part of the org-mode
distribution.  You can export an Org-mode document to a
LaTeX file with `C-c C-e l'.  For more options, see the
manual, and the commentary in the Lisp file.  Kudos to
Bastien for contributing this frequently requested feature.
I am sure this has been tough because of the many different
ways I have been allowing LaTeX snippets and environments to
be incorporated in lazy free-format ways.

</li>
<li>
Org-mode has now an extension mechanism for the hyperlink
system.  This should clear the road for all those mairix and
other ideas that have been floating around.  Now it is on
<b>you</b> to write and share new link types for Org-mode.  The
interface for adding a new link type is described in the
appendix of the manual, section A2.  The unsolved problem is
currently how to handle the new link types for
export/publishing.

</li>
<li>
New <b>global</b> commands `org-open-at-point-global' and
`org-insert-link-global'.  You can bind these commands to
global keys and use them to insert and follow Org-mode-like
links anywhere in Emacs.  Thanks to Adam Spiers for this
excellent idea.

</li>
<li>
Each deadline timestamp may now specify its own interval of
lead-time display, given in days, weeks, months or years.
The syntax is like this

<p>
<pre>
 DEADLINE: &lt;2007-08-13 Mon -5d&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>
When combined with a repeater, the repeater has to come
first:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
 DEADLINE: &lt;2007-08-13 Mon +2w -5d&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>
You may now also customize the faces that are used in the
agenda to indicate the distance of an approaching deadline.
See the new option `org-agenda-deadline-faces'.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to Pavel Chalmoviansky and John Wiegley proposals in
this direction.
</p>
</li>
<li>
New option `org-agenda-repeating-timestamp-show-all'.  When
set to nil, repeating time stamps will only show up once in
the agenda, either today or in the near future.  Other
matches will be ignored.  Thanks to John Wiegley for this
proposal.

</li>
<li>
New variable `org-remember-store-without-prompt'.  When set,
exiting the remember buffer with C-c C-c will store the note
without further prompts to the default location, and `C-u
C-c C-c' will get the prompts for file and location.  So
this variable reverses the prefix-argument functionality for
storing remember notes.  This follows a request from John
Wiegley.

</li>
<li>
A new function `org-agenda-to-appt' activates all
appointments for the current day so that Emacs will display
reminders.  This uses appt.el.  Thanks to Bastien for this
function.

</li>
<li>
You can now set default values for properties that can be
inherited by all entries in a buffer, or by all entries
globally.  Global properties are set in the variable
`org-global-properties', like this:

<p>
(setq org-global-properties '(("NAME" "This is the value")))
</p>
<p>
Buffer-local values are set like this:
</p>
<p>
#+PROPERTY: NAME This is the value
</p>
<p>
When using org-entry-get to get the value of a property with
the `inherit' flag and the hierarchy above the entry does
not contain this property, the buffer-local and global lists
are checked as well.  This is mostly useful (I think) to set
the list of allowed values for a property.  Thanks to Bernt
Hansen and Bastien for these ideas.

<h2>Version 5.03</h2>



<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Incompatible Changes</h3>


<ul>
<li>
The variable `org-special-ctrl-a' has been renamed to
`org-special-ctrl-a/e'.  The old one is still an alias (but
not on Emacs 21 where variable aliases cannot be defined).

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li>
When the variable `org-special-ctrl-a/e' is set, C-e in a
headline first goes to the end of the headline ignoring the
tags.  A second C-e then goes to after the tags.

</li>
<li>
Typing and removing single characters in a headline now
keeps the tags in the headline aligned.  This could have a
little impact on performance while deleting stuff - let me
know if we need to make this customizable.

</li>
<li>
New option `org-n-level-faces' can be used to set the number
of different faces that are used for headlines.  Default is
all 8 faces Org-mode defines for this purpose, level 9 uses
again the level-1 face.  However, you can use fewer, and then
the level-1 face will be reused already for level N+1, etc.

The interfaces for properties and column view are finished
now and work well.

</li>
<li>
Properties can be summaries, i.e. the parent nodes can
compute their value from the children's values.

</li>
<li>
Headlines finally require a space ofter the star(s).  The
conflict with bold text at the beginning of the line is no
longer there.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Incompatible Changes</h3>


<ul>
<li>
Bad news.  It looks like it is going to be really hard to
make column view work on XEmacs and on Emacs 21.  Emacs 22
is currently the only Emacs where this works.  If you are
using Emacs 21 or XEmacs, you can still use properties, but
not column view.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li>
Improvements for properties:

<ul>
<li>
There are interactive commands to insert and delete
properties.  Read the manual chapter 7 for details.

</li>
<li>
You can define <i>allowed values</i> for a property.  When
these are defined, you can change the value of a property
with S-left and S-right.  And you may use completion when
inserting the property.  This goes a long way to prevent
typos when entering properties.

</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
Improvements for column view.

<ul>
<li>
In column view, you may use the keys S-left/right (and
also the keys `n' and `p') to switch from one allowed
value to the next.

</li>
<li>
You can define summaries for columns.  For example,
parents can contain the sum of all children values of a
property, or the parent node can have a check box property
that is automatically checked when all children's boxes are
checked.

</li>
<li>
There are interactive commands to add and remove columns,
and to change the attributes of a column like the summary
type.

</li>
</ul>
<p>These additions lead to the exciting fact that the example
from <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/images/applications/omnioutliner/features/multicolumn.jpg">omni outliner</a> posted by Scott Jaderholm can now be
accurately <a href="omni-org.jpg">reproduced by Org-mode</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
The space after the stars is now required in a headline, in
order to remove the conflict with bold words at the
beginning of a line.  So

<p>
<pre>
    * This is a level 1 headline
    *this is bold text*
</pre>
</p>

<div class="outline-4">
<h4>Orgstruct minor mode</h4>


<p>
There is a new minor mode, orgstruct-mode.  This modes works
in a similar way as Orgtbl-mode.  It can be used to export
the Org-mode structure-editing commands into arbitrary major
modes in Emacs.  For example, you can use it in Mail-mode to
easily create lists.
</p>
<p>
The functionality in Orgstruct mode is only active, if the
cursor is in a line that looks either like a headline, or
like the first line of a plain list item.  Then the commands
`TAB', `M-cursor', `M-S-cursor', `M-RET', `M-S-RET', `C-c ^',
`C-c C-c', and `C-c -' will do structure-related editing just
like in Org-mode.  If the cursor is not in such a line, all
these keys will do whatever the major mode or other active
minor modes have assigned to them.
</p>
<p>
Orgstruct-mode is the result of a proposal by Raman, quite
some time ago.  It has taken a long time, but here is finally
the promised implementation.
</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-4">
<h4>Drawers</h4>


<p>
The new concept of <i>drawers</i> allows to create sections
that remain folded during visibility cycling.  Drawers need
to be configured using the variable `org-drawers'.  A drawer
starts with a line containing only the name of the drawer
bracketed by colons. It ends with :END:.  For example,
after setting
</p>
<p>
<pre>
   (setq org-drawers '("PROPERTIES" "HIDDEN"))
</pre>
</p>
<p>
you can then create drawers like this:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
   :HIDDEN:
     here is some stuff that remains hidden
     unless TAB is pressed directly in that line
   :END:
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The PROPERTIES drawer has special meaning for ORG-mode, it
contains properties of an entry (see below).
</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-4">
<h4>Properties and Column View</h4>


<ul>
<li>
Entries in Org-mode can now have arbitrary <i>properties</i>
associated with them.  Org-mode handles some default
properties like the TODO state, the priority, the local
tags, and planning information like DEADLINE and SCHEDULED.
In addition, you can assign arbitrary properties by creating
a property drawer and inserting a line like

<p>
<pre>
   :PROPNAME: This is the value of the property
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Org-mode has an API for properties, if you want to write a
program using properties, use the functions
`org-entry-properties', `org-entry-get', `org-entry-put',
and `org-entry-delete'.
</p>
</li>
<li>
Planning information like DEADLINE can be hidden in the
properties drawer.

<p>
If the PROPERTIES drawer starts in the first line after a
headline, also the DEADLINE, SCHEDULED and CLOCK information
will be inserted inside the drawer.  If no PROPERTIES drawer
is present, or if it does not start in the line right after
the headline, this information remains in the lines directly
after the headline, outside the drawer.
</p>
</li>
<li>
TAGS searches can now also query properties.  For example,
the search

<p>
<pre>
   LEVEL=3+BOSS+ASSIGNED="Hans"/WAITING
</pre>
</p>
<p>
will find entries that
</p><ul>
<li>
are level 3
</li>
<li>
have the tag BOSS
</li>
<li>
have an ASSIGNED property with the value "Hans"
</li>
<li>
are TODO status WAITING.

<p>
So here is an entry that will match:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
   *** WAITING Clean up the factory     :BOSS:
       :PROPERTIES:
       :ASSIGNED: Hans
       :END:
</pre>
</p>
<p>
You may also use a regular expression to match against a
property value.  For example, to find stuff assigned to Hans
or Sarah, use
</p>
<p>
<pre>
   ASSIGNED={^\(Hans\|Sarah\)$}
</pre>
</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
Column View is a special way to look at property values in
tabular form.  Column View can be used in any org-mode
file, and also in any agenda buffer.  It works by placing
an overlay over each headline (or agenda line) that shows a
table of selected properties.  You can look at and edit
properties from this view.  Which properties are shown in
the table must be set up using the COLUMNS property.  You
can set up different property columns on different levels
of an outline tree.  For example:

<p>
<pre>
   * People
     :PROPERTIES:
     :COLUMNS: %25ITEM %Name
     :END:
   ** Family
      :PROPERTIES:
      :COLUMNS: %25ITEM %Name %3Age
      :END:
   *** Sam
       Info about Sam, including a property list with Name and Age.
   *** Sarah
       Info about Sarah, including a property list with Name and Age.
   ** Office
      :PROPERTIES:
      :COLUMNS: %25ITEM %Name %Function %Salary
      :END:
   *** Boss
       Info about the Boss, including a property list with Name,
       Function and Salary (if only we knew....).
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Now we have defined three different sets of columns.  If
you switch to column view in the <i>Family</i> section, you
will get a different table than if you do it in the
<i>Office</i> section.  However, if you switch to column
view with the cursor on the <i>People</i> section, the
table will cover all entries, but contain only the
<i>Name</i>.
</p>
<p>
Column view does, for the time being, only work on Emacs.
The XEmacs implementation needs a bit of work.
</p>
</li>
<li>
Properties can be used in table formulas.  To access the
value of the property :XYZ:, use $PROP_XYZ.  The property
needs to be defined in the hierarchy above the table, not
necessarily in the same entry as the table.  This was a
request by Eddward.  File-wide constants can be defined with
#+CONSTANTS, see below.

</li>
<li>
Things that still need to be sorted out about drawers,
properties and column view - comments and suggestions
welcome!

<ul>
<li>
How to deal with drawers and properties in HTML and ASCII
export?
</li>
<li>
What key could be used to insert an empty property drawer
into an entry?
</li>
<li>
Right now column view is invoked through the command C-c
C-x C-c.  It is too easy to type C-x C-c by mistake, and
that causes Emacs to quit.  Suggestions for a different
key?
</li>
<li>
Fontification of drawers and properties is not good yet.
Any suggestions for better defaults?
</li>
<li>
Mouse support for editing properties in column view would
be nice - maybe Piotr is interested to add this to
org-mouse.el?

</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-4">
<h4>Spreadsheet</h4>


<ul>
<li>
In the spreadsheet, the evaluation of formulas has changed.
Previously, first the column formulas would be evaluated
everywhere, and then the field formulas would kick in, and
in some cases overwrite the results of column formulas in
the appropriate fields.  This had the side effect that some
formulas might always use the wrong, intermediate content of
a field that is computed both by a column and a field
formula.

<p>
From now on, column formulas will no longer temporarily
overwrite field formulas.  This gives much more consistent
results.  For example you can now finally have a column of
increasing numbers by setting the first field to a fixed
number, and let the rest follow from a column formula.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example
</p>
<p>
<pre>
   | 1 |
   | 2 |
   | 3 |
   #+TBLFM: $1=@-1+1::@1$1=1
</pre>
</p>
</li>
<li>
Constants for formulas in spreadsheets are globally defined
with the variable `org-table-formula-constants'.  File-local
constants can now be set with a line like:

<p>
<pre>
   #+CONSTANTS: c=299792458.  pi=3.14  eps=2.4e-6
</pre>
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-4">
<h4>Minor changes</h4>


<ul>
<li>
When entries are archived, a timestamp for the moment of
archiving is added to the line with planning information.
It looks like this:

<p>
<pre>
 ARCHIVED: [2007-07-02 Mon 11:34]
</pre>

<h2>Version 4.78</h2>



<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Overview</h3>


<ul>
<li>
Time stamps with a time range <b>included</b>, like
<pre>
 &lt;2007-06-18 Mon 17:33-18:23&gt;
</pre>

</li>
<li>
Clock times without clocking in/out: CLOCK: =&gt; 2:00

<li>
Language-specific characters allowed in TAGS (Emacs only).

</li>
<li>
Promotion and demotion of items gets the indentation right.

</li>
<li>
Indenting lines with TAB is more intelligent.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Incompatible changes</h3>


<ul>
<li>
There is now a special version of `org.el' for XEmacs.
Before installation, as an XEmacs user you must rename the
file org_xemacs.el to org.el, i.e. you must overwrite org.el
with the xemacs version.  For example:

<p>
<pre>
 mv org_xemacs.el org.el
</pre>
</p>
<p>
This is necessary so that I can make use of some features
that would be cumbersome to support in a single file.  The
XEmacs version is derived from the Emacs version with a
program, so no reason to fear that I might be dropping
XEmacs support any time soon.  Sorry for the trouble.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li>
A time stamp may now contain a range of times.  So you no
longer need to use two separate stamps to indicate a time
interval on a single day.  For example

<p>
<pre>
 &lt;2007-06-18 Mon 17:30-18:20&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p>
This is now fully supported, including changing the time
with S-up/down while the cursor is on the end time.  Also,
da the date/time prompt, you can simply write your time like
12:00-14:00 and the range will be inserted.
</p>
<p>
This was proposed by Leo some time ago, and recently by
Michael.
</p>
</li>
<li>
You may specify clocking times by hand (i.e. without
clocking in and out) using this syntax.

<p>
<pre>
 CLOCK: =&gt; 2:00
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Thanks to Scott Jaderholm for this proposal.
</p>
</li>
<li>
TAGS may now contain language-specific word characters, as
long as they are matched by the "[:alnum:]" regexp syntax.
This is for Emacs only, the XEmacs version continues to use
the character class "a-zA-Z0-9_@" for tag names.  Thanks to
David Smith for a patch to this effect (a modified version
of that patch was applied).  I am considering to make the
same change for TODO keywords, but not yet.  Note that files
using localization features may not work correctly in the
Emacs configuration of another user, so if you are sharing
org-mode files with other users, it might still be best to
stick to the ASCII characters.

</li>
<li>
Promotion and demotion of plain list items (commands M-left,
M-right) no longer changes the indentation by just one
space.  Instead, it uses intelligence gathered from the
surrounding list structure to do the right thing.  Thanks to
William Henney for starting the discussion about this.

</li>
<li>
TAB does now a better job of indenting lines.

<ul>
<li>
After tables and code segments (lines starting with ":"),
indentation goes back to what it was before (thanks to
William Henney for suggesting this behavior).

</li>
<li>
When plain lists items are involved, we had a long
discussion on emacs-orgmode where I tried to show that a
too-sophisticated implementation will still be easily
fooled.   Here is what I have implemented now - lets see
if we can agree on this:

<p>
Indentation will flatten lists with the same bullet type,
but indent another bullet type further.  The time when
this fails is in a nested list, when you want to get back
out to a previous level.  For example
</p>
<p>
<pre>
 - item 1
 - item 2
 + item 2a
 + item 2b
 - item 3
</pre>
</p>
<p>
When using TAB on every line in this list, the structure
will change to
</p>
<p>
<pre>
 - item 1
 - item 2
   + item 2a
   + item 2b
     - item 3
</pre>
</p>
<p>
So you need to change the level of the last line by hand,
using promotion and demotion functions.

<ul>
<li>
You can now specify column groups in tables, to the effect
that the groups will be separated by vertical lines in HTML
and ASCII output.  Column groups are specified by the
characters "&lt;" and "&gt;" in a special table row.  "&lt;" starts a
group, "&gt;" ends a group (in each case including the the
column where the character is specified).  You may also use
"&lt;&gt;" to make a group a single column wide.  For example:

<p>
<pre>
 |   |  N | N^2 | N^3 | N^4 | sqrt(n) | sqrt[4](N) |
 |---+----+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
 | / | &lt;&gt; |   &lt; |     |   &gt; |       &lt; |          &gt; |
 | # |  1 |   1 |   1 |   1 |       1 |          1 |
 | # |  2 |   4 |   8 |  16 |  1.4142 |     1.1892 |
 | # |  3 |   9 |  27 |  81 |  1.7321 |     1.3161 |
 #+TBLFM: $3=$2^2::$4=$2^3::$5=$2^4::$6=sqrt($2)::$7=sqrt(sqrt(($2))
</pre>
</p>
<p>
A table row with with nothing but "/" in the first field is
never exported, but can be used to place column group
information into the table.  In this table, we create a
group for column 2, one for columns 3-5 and one for columns
6-7.  HTML export will render a vertical line between these
groups.
</p>
<p>
Because HTML does not require closing &lt;colgroup&gt; tags with
&lt;/colgroup&gt;), you can also simply start a new column
wherever you want a vertical line:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
 | N | N^2 | N^3 | N^4 | sqrt(n) | sqrt[4](N0 |
 |---+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
 | / | &lt;   | &lt;   |     | &lt;       |            |
</pre>
</p>
</li>
<li>
Vertical lines are now also omitted in ASCII export, unless
grouping explicitly requests these lines.

</li>
<li>
The default for `org-show-following-heading' is now nil,
meaning that sparse trees will be more compact.  This has
become possible due to in important remark by Jason Dunsmore
who pointed out that TAB should behave differently in the
inconsistent trees produced by the sparse tree commands.
TAB does now make sure that the heading after a freshly
unfolded tree is made visible at all, removing the confusing
behavior we had before.

</li>
<li>
Several bugs fixed.  In particular:

<ul>
<li>
Strings produced by agenda batch processing with
`org-batch-agenda' and `org-batch-agenda-csv' are now
properly encoded, so that you should be able to use
special characters in other languages as along as your
post-processing program handles them correctly.  At least
for Emacs this should work now, but have not yet figured
out how to do this in XEmacs.

</ul></div>

<div class="outline-3">

<ul>
<li>
Time stamps can contain a repeater code, like +1w for once
every week, +2d for every two days, etc.  For example,

</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="timestamp">2007-05-16 Wed 12:30 +1w</span><br/>
</p>
<p>
will apply to every Wednesday, starting from the date given.
I believe this syntax was actually suggested by someone on
the mailing list, but I cannot find the email back.  To
collect your credit, let me know!
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You can use an sexp diary entry (with the syntax used by the
Emacs calendar/diary) in a time stamp, like this:

<p>
*** The nerd club meets on 2nd Thursday of every month
</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="timestamp">%%(diary-float t 4 2)</span><br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You can put diary-style sexp entries directly into an
org-mode file, where they will be interpreted just like they
would in the diary.  For example

<ul>
<li>
Birthdays and similar stuff
</li>
</ul>
<p>#+CATEGORY: Holiday
%%(org-calendar-holiday) ; special function for holiday names
#+CATEGORY: Ann
%%(diary-anniversary 14  5 1956) Artur Dent %d is years old
%%(diary-anniversary  2 10 1869) Mahatma Gandhi
</p>
<p>
These entries must start at column 0 to be evaluated.
</p>
<p>
It turns out that evaluating the entries in an org-mode file
is actually faster than in the diary itself, because using
the diary has some overhead (creating fancy diary display,
then reading and re-interpreting the entries).  I have moved
all the sexp entries from my diary into an org-mode file,
put in a few categories, and then turned off
`org-agenda-include-diary'.  This has led to a noticeably
faster agenda display.
</p>
</li>
<li>
New command `org-replace-region-by-html' that converts the
current region from org-mode syntax into HTML.  For example,
you might write an itemized list in plain text in an HTML
buffer, and then invoke this command to convert it.  Thanks
to Raman for this idea.

</li>
<li>
When inserting a link with `C-c C-l', completion will now
fill in all valid link prefixes, like http or ftp, but also
link abbreviation prefixes.  This is based on an idea by
Bastien.

</li>
<li>
Highest, lowest, and default priority can be set on a
per-file basis with #+PRIORITIES: H L D
For example, to use priorities from 1 to 9, you could use

<p>
#+PRIORITIES: 1 9 9
</p>
<p>
Thanks to Dmitri Minaev for a patch to this effect.
</p>
</li>
<li>
iCalendar export now honors (i.e. skips) subtrees marked as
ARCHIVE, COMMENT, or QUOTE.

</li>
<li>
There is a new command to add or change the emphasis (like
bold or italic) of a piece of text.  For lack of better
available keys the command is at `C-c C-x C-f', but you may
well want to choose a more convenient key like `C-c f' in
your private setup:

<p>
(add-hook 'org-load-hook
(lambda () (define-key org-mode-map "\C-cf" 'org-emphasize)))
</p>
<p>
The command will prompt for an emphasis type, and you may
reply either with the marker that triggers the emphasis, or
with the first letter of the corresponding HTML tag.  For
example, to select italic, press either "/" or "i".
</p>
<p>
If there is an active region, the emphasis of this region
will be set or changed.  If there is no region, only the
emphasis markers will be inserted and the cursor positioned
between them.  Thanks to Bastien for proposing this feature.
</p>

Agenda views can be exported as plain text, as HTML, and as
Postscript(R).  This can simply be done from the agenda
buffer with `C-x C-w' and then specifying a filename like
`myagenda.html' or `myagenda.ps'.  See section 8.6.4 of the
manual.

</li>
<li>
Each custom agenda view can specify a list of associated
files names.  The command `C-c a e' then creates all views
that have associated file names and exports the views to
these files.  This is great for producing paper versions of
your views, to take with you when you don't have your
computer.  The manual has an example on how to do this, and
in particular on how to customize the format of the printed
version.  See section 8.6.4 of the manual.

</li>
<li>
You can produce a CSV format of agenda information with an
Emacs batch command.  This is greate for further processing
in scipts.  Thanks to Jason F. McBrayer for this idea.
See section 8.6.5 of the manual.

<div class="outline-3">

<ul>
<li>
Better control over blank lines between trees in collapsed
view.  This has come up several times in the past and most
recently by Scott Jaderholm.  There is now a new variable
`org-cycle-separator-lines' with default value 2.  It says
how many empty lines there need to be after the end of a
subtree to get an empty line in collapsed view.  So with the
default, if you leave only one empty line it will disappear
in collapsed view.  If you leave two, one empty line will
remain so that you can use double empty lines to structure
the collapsed views of a file.  I love it, so many thanks to
Scott fro bringing this up again.

<p>
One property of the new setup is that you will never get
more than one blank line in collapsed view.  We could do
something special to allow <b>several</b> empty lines in
collapsed view, but I think this is counter-productive.
</p>
<p>
In Emacs 22, if you want to make full use of this, make sure
that you have not set `outline-blank-line'.
</p>
</li>
<li>
When the clock is running, Org-mode will put info about it
into the modeline.  The info consists of the elapsed time
and the heading of the clocked item.  This was a proposal
from Bastien who got the idea from Muse.

</li>
<li>
C-a can behave specially in headlines when you set the
variable `org-special-ctrl-a'.  It will bring the cursor
first back only to the beginning of the headline <b>text</b>,
i.e. after the stars and the TODO keyword, if any.  A second
C-a will then move the cursor to the beginning of the line.
If the cursor is already at the beginning of the line, C-a
will spring <b>forward</b> to the headline text.  This was a
proposal from Leo, based on a request from Scott Jaderholm.

<p>
I have not turned this turned this on by default, should I?
</p>
</li>
<li>
When LaTeX fragments are processed into images, there is now
more control and (hopefully) betters defaults for colors and
scaling.  Special values can be set for HTML export, so that
these values can differ from what is used for display in an
emacs buffer.  The default foreground and background colors
for images embedded in emacs are now taken from the default
emacs face.  Thanks to Xiao-Yong Jin for proposing these
changes.

</li>
<li>
There is now a much better mechanism to change some keys in
org-mode if these keys clash with other modes you use.  Turn
this on by setting `org-replace-disputed-keys' (aliased to
`org-CUA-compatible').  The list of keys to replace is now
fully customizable, see the option `org-disputed-keys'.
Many thanks to Meciej Katafiasz for a patch implementing
this.

</li>
<li>
Stuck project descriptions have been extended.  You can now
use "*" as a TODO keyword or tag to say that <b>any</b> TODO
keyword or TAG marks a project as non-stuck.  You also can
give an arbitrary regular expression that, if it matches,
indicates a non-stuck project.

</li>
<li>

</div>

<div class="outline-3">

<ul>
<li>
New variables to customize the header and data tags in
exported HTML.  These are the variables
`org-export-table-header-tags' and
`org-export-table-data-tags'.  This follows a request from
Scott Otterson.

</li>
<li>
New option `org-format-latex-header' for customizing the
header of the LaTeX file used to convert embedded LaTeX to
images.  Thanks to `Matthieu Lemerre' for the suggestion.

</li>
<li>
The prefix version of `org-todo-list' works again.  This
means that `C-1 C-c a t' produces the list of TODO entries
for the first TODO keyword.  If you use different TODO setups
in different agenda files, be careful:  This number now
refers to the list of <b>all</b> todo keywords used in files
that are scanned for the agenda.

<li>
Many bug fixes.

<li>
Further development concerning TODO keywords.

<ul>
<li>
You can now have several DONE states in a sequence, like

<p>
#+SEQ_TODO: TODO VERIFY | DONE DELEGATED
</p>
<p>
The difference to the proposal discussed on the mailing
list (and which is also works!)
</p>
<p>
#+SEQ_TODO: TODO VERIFY | DONE
#+SEQ_TODO: | CANCELED
</p>
<p>
is that in the first case, the extra DONE states will be
reached with `C-c C-t' (or with `t' from the agenda), while
in the second case you need S-&lt;right&gt; to get to the special
states.  I guess both ideas can be useful - I am leaning
toward using the latter.
</p>
</li>
<li>
Setting up TODO keywords in Lisp previously used two
separate variables: `org-todo-keywords' and
`org-todo-interpretation'.  The preferred way is now to use
only `org-todo-keywords', with a new structure:

<p>
(setq org-todo-keywords
'((sequence "TODO" "|" "DONE")
(sequence "BUG" "KNOWNCAUSE" "|" "FIXED" "IGNORED")
(type "Fred" "Lisa" "Peter" "|" "DONE")
(sequence "CANCELED")    ; for things we decide to not do.
))
</p>
<p>
If your setting has this new structure,
`org-todo-interpretation' will be ignored.  This change
does not break backward compatibility.  The old way of
using a flat list in `org-todo-keywords' and taking the
interpretation from the other variable still works.
</p>
</li>
<li>
When listing <b>specific</b> TODO entries via a sparse tree
(`C-u C-c C-v') or via the agenda (`C-c a T' or `C-u C-c a
t'), you can now specify several keywords to be selected,
like "TODO|VERIFY|WAITING".  This also works for custom
agenda commands.  Thanks to Jason F. McBrayer for pointing
out this omission.

</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
If you have configured Org-mode to export also the text
before the first headline (this is done by setting the
variable `org-export-skip-text-before-1st-heading' to nil),
then the first normal text line in the buffer becomes the
title of the exported document.  A title set with #+TITLE
overules this default, and the first line then belongs to the
normal text.  Thanks to David House for this proposal.

</li>
<li>
TTY replacement keys.  Some of the key bindings used by
Org-mode do not work on a tty, so replacement key sequences
are provided on ttys.  In version 4.70, there are some
changes in the tty replacements.  Thanks to Jason F. McBrayer
for coming up with the idea to use C-c &lt;cursor&gt; keys.

<h2>Version 4.69</h2>



<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Overview</h3>


<p>
This time the changes affect the following areas:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
TODO keywords:  Multiple sequences in a single file.
</li>
<li>
Export: More control over text before the first heading.
</li>
<li>
Export: More control over sub/superscript interpretation.
</li>
<li>
Plain lists:  Option to let empty lines terminate lists.
</li>
<li>
Tables: New command to insert hline and move into line below.
</li>
<li>
REPEATing items:  Turn of note taking.
</li>
<li>
Bug fixes.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Incompatible changes</h3>


<ul>
<li>
It used to be possible to spread the list of TODO keywords
over several lines, like

<p>
#+SEQ_TODO: TODO
#+SEQ_TODO: PROGRESS
#+SEQ_TODO: DONE
</p>
<p>
This is no longer possible.  Each such line now specifies an
independent set of TODO keywords, with its own DONE state.
See below for details.
</p>
</li>
<li>
The #+TEXT construct has been used to insert unchanged HTML
into an exported file.  This is no longer possible, the TEXT
lines will be processed like any other lines.  However,
there are now much better ways of getting quoted HTML into
the exported file.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li>
You can now use multiple sets of TODO keywords in the same
buffer.  For example, you may put the following three lines
into a file:

<p>
#+SEQ_TODO: TODO DONE
#+SEQ_TODO: REPORT BUG KNOWNCAUSE RESOLVED
#+TYP_TODO: Fred Laura Peter Me OK
</p>
<p>
Each sub-sequence has its own DONE state.  It is best to use
different keywords in all sequences, to make sure Org-mode
does not loose track in which specific sequence it is
working.  You could use the same word for all DONE states,
but then cycling through to a TODO state might not bring you
where you want to be.
</p>
<p>
After initially setting a keyword, `C-c C-t' cycles through
a sublist, i.e. is cycles from TODO to DONE or from
KNOWNCAUSE to RESOLVED and further to (nothing) and back to
REPORT.
</p>
<p>
S-right and S-left allow to select any keyword, so they move
from DONE to REPORT and from RESOLVED to Fred.
</p>
<p>
C-S-right and C-S-left jump from one sub-sequence to the
next, for example from TODO or DONE to REPORT to Fred.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to Rick Moynihan for triggering this development.
</p>
</li>
<li>
Text before the first headline can now be exported if you
configure Org-mode accordingly.  Either set the variable
`org-export-skip-text-before-1st-heading' to nil, or use the
new in-buffer option

<p>
#+OPTION: skip:nil
</p>
</li>
<li>
Export content specified via the #+TEXT construct is now
fully processed, i.e. links, emphasis etc. are all
interpreted.  #+TEXT lines may include
#+BEGIN_HTML&hellip;#+END_HTML sections to embed literal HTML.

</li>
<li>
During HTML export, you can request to have a<sub>b</sub>
interpreted as a subscript, but to leave a_b as it is.  This
can be done by setting the variable
org-export-sub-superscript to the symbol `{}' with

<p>
(setq org-export-sub-superscript '{})
</p>
<p>
or by using
</p>
<p>
#+OPTIONS: ^:{}
</p>
<p>
Thanks to Eddward DeVilla for this idea.
</p>
</li>
<li>
New variable `org-empty-line-terminates-plain-lists'.
Default is nil, meaning that empty lines are part of the
previous list item, and that you can have several paragraphs
in one such item.  Set this to t if you want an empty line
terminate all levels of plain list items.

<p>
Thanks to Mike Newman for triggering this development.
</p>
</li>
<li>
C-c RET does insert a horizontal separator line and move the
cursor into the table line below it.  Thanks to Bastien for
this proposal.

</li>
<li>
Org-mode always offers you to record a note when a TODO item
automatically repeats, even if you are not logging state
changes.  The new variable `org-log-repeat' allows to turn
this off, so that notes are really only been taken if you
are logging all state changes.

Improvements to the date/time prompt.

<ul>
<li>
When you move (using S-cursor keys) the cursor in the pop-up

</li>
<li>
You can now enter AM/PM times at this prompt.

</ul></li>
<li>
Changes in the spreadsheet

<ul>
<li>
You can now also write B4 instead of @4$2 as a reference in
formulas.  The column references without specified row can be
written as C&amp; instead of $3.  Such references make formulas
easier to read and are now the default way how references are
shown when you edit existing formulas.  To get the old behavior
back (i.e. only @row$col references), set the variable
`org-table-use-standard-references' to nil.

<p>
Relative references like @-3$-2 or @II..III continue to use the
internal format.
</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
Changes in the formula editor (the one you get with "C-c '")

<ul>
<li>
The formulas are organized in a more logical way.

</li>
<li>
There is now a menu with commands.

</li>
<li>
When starting the formula editor with "C-c '", the cursor
immediately moves to the formula for the current field.

</li>
<li>
With the cursor on a reference in the formula, you can use
S-cursor keys to change the field being referenced.

<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Overview</h3>


<ul>
<li>
Sorting of top-level entries works now if the region contains
top-level entries, or if the cursor is before the first headline.
Thanks to "redblue" for reporting this bug.

</li>
<li>
When entering date and time at the prompt, you can now mix
entering text and selecting something in the calendar.  For
example, enter 22:15 at the prompt without pressing RET, and then
click on a date in the calendar.  Both pieces of information will
be included in the resulting time stamp.  You can also use
S-curser to move the cursor in the calendar to the desired date
and then enter 22:15 and press RET at the prompt.

</li>
<li>
When setting a deadline or a schedule, entering a time now
automatically selects the time stamp format that includes the
time. Bug report (by means of a question) from Bastre.

</li>
<li>
C-c C-l can be used to convert a plain link into a bracket link.

</li>
<li>
Internal links now match inside (the visible part of) other
links.  Thanks to Scott Otterson for reporting this bug.

</li>
<li>
iCalendar export of TODO items fixed, see also the variable
`org-icalendar-include-todo'.  Thanks to Philipp Raschdorf.

</li>
<li>
The number of levels in the table of contents of an exported
document can now be set independently of the number of headline
levels.  For example:

<p>
#+OPTIONS: H:4 toc:2
</p>
</li>
<li>
The command `C-c }' toggles the display of row and column numbers
the the current table, to aid constructing formulas.  To try it,
move the cursor to a table and press `C-c }', or use the menu
entry.

</li>
<li>
Orgtbl translation functions (introduced in 4.65) have been
simplified using a generic function `orgtbl-to-generic' that can
be used for very general languanges.  Writing your own translator
should be very easy now.  More info in the manual.

</li>
<li>
CONTENTS visibility can be limited to a certain level.  The
command `C-3 S-TAB' will switch to CONTENTS view and show the
first 3 levels.

<h2>Version 4.65</h2>



<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Overview</h3>


<ul>
<li>
Orgtbl can be used to maintain tables in LaTeX, and in any other mode
</li>
<li>
Editing Lisp formulas for tables improved.
</li>
<li>
Better structure for HTML exported tables.
</li>
<li>
New "calculation" marker "/" to mark lines that should not be exported.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Detailed description of changes</h3>


<ul>
<li>
You can use orgtbl mode to maintain a LaTeX table, or pretty much
any table in any mode.

<p>
This does <b>not</b> work by making Orgtbl aware of LaTeX syntax.  That
would be a box of Pandora I am not willing to open.  Instead, you
use a normal Orgtbl-mode table, and a converter program to
automatically place a LaTeX version of the table into the correct
spot in the LaTeX file.  The orgtbl-mode table can be maintained
inside the same file, in a block comment.
</p>
<p>
I am providing translators for LaTeX, HTML, and TeXInfo.  For
other applications, you need to write one yourself - but that is
not hard if you start from the LaTeX version and just modify it.
Thanks to Thomas Baumann for triggering this development through
a request for a table-to-LaTeX converter.
</p>
</li>
<li>
In the special buffer to edit the formulas of a table (created
with "C-c '"), there is now better support for editing Lisp
formulas.  TAB and M-TAB work like in an Emacs Lisp buffer,
indenting lines and completing lisp symbols.  With the cursor on
a line defining a complex Lisp formula, a first press on TAB will
convert the formula into a pretty-printed version with proper
linebreaks and indentation.  A second TAB folds the line back to
the compact form.

</li>
<li>
Tables in HTML export have now additional structure elements
defined.  The header (before the first hline) is wrapped into
&lt;thead&gt;..&lt;/thead&gt;, and each part of the body (as separated in
org-mode by hlines) is wrapped into &lt;tbody&gt;..&lt;/tbody&gt; tags.  I
have also changed the CSS style for &lt;td&gt; fields and the value of
`org-export-html-table-tag' to get cleaner tables. Basically,
tables now have horizontal lines only where needed, and no
vertical lines at all, as generally recommended for tables in
printed text.  I like the new look, but I am not sure if this
change will find general approval, please throw in your view if
you like.  Thanks to Scott for driving this, and to goud-H for
pointing me to the row grouping in tables.

</li>
<li>
In a table with calculation markers in the first column, you can
now also put "/" into the first column.  It indicates that this
line should not be exported.  The foremost application for this
are lines containing only "&lt;N&gt;" markers for narrowing columns.

</li>
</ul></div>

<h2>Version 4.64</h2>



<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Overview</h3>


<ul>
<li>
Email links get better, configurable descriptions
</li>
<li>
When inserting a link, selected text becomes the description
</li>
<li>
Easier access to the list of stored links.
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
Remember templates and storing of notes improved.

</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="outline-3">
<h3>Detailed description of changes</h3>


<ul>
<li>
The descriptive part of links to email messages can be configured
using the variable `org-email-link-description-format'.  The new
default is "Email %c: %.30s" and leads to

<p>
Email from NAME: SUBJECT
</p>
<p>
If you configure the variable `org-from-is-user-regexp'
correctly, then for email you <b>sent</b> this will actually change to
</p>
<p>
Email to NAME: SUBJECT
</p>
<p>
The subject is limited to 30 characters.  If you have become
attached to the previous default (look twice, the new one is
better), use "%f on: %s" as your format.
</p>
</li>
<li>
Selecting text before entering a new link with C-c C-l now really
works, the selected text becomes the description part of the
link.  Requested by Scott, buggy 4.62 implementation is now fixed.

</li>
<li>
Stored links are part of the history list for C-c C-l, so to
reach them, you can use up/down rather than completion.  Thanks
to Raman for this excellent idea.

</li>
<li>
A line consisting only of "-", and at least 5 of them, is
exported into HTML as &lt;hr/&gt;, as proposed by Giovanni Ridolfi.

</li>
<li>
Several changes to org &lt;-&gt; remember integration

<ul>
<li>
You can use `org-remember' as your default command to start
remember.  It will automatically detect if there is an active
region and use it as initial content (we will probably make
remember.el work like this as well).
Also, when calling `org-remember' in a remember buffer that
was created with a template, you will again be asked to
select a template.  The buffer is then re-created with the
new template, but the old context information.  This is
useful if you change your mind about the template to use
(Leo's idea).

</li>
<li>
Besides specifying a default <b>target</b> file for a note, you
can also give a default <b>heading</b> of which the note should
become a subitem.  In many cases this avoids or speeds up
navigating to the right location.  Both file and heading can
be different for each template.  Both are non-binding, you
can change them while storing the note.  However, when you
exit remember with C-u C-c C-c, these defaults will be used
without interaction.

</li>
<li>
Templates can specify interactive fields.  During expansion
of the template, you will be prompted for the information in
that field.  For example %^t will pop up a calendar and ask
you to select a date. This new feature follows a proposal
from Leo, who in the mean time has said he does not need it
anymore.  But I liked it, so here it is :-)

</li>
<li>
Templates can access information specific to the link type
created, for example the author and subject of an email.
Syntax is %:fromname, %:fromaddress, %:subject etc, details
in the manual.  Proposed by Peder O. Klingenberg.

</li>
<li>
I have been considering to move, at some stage, the template
functionality into remember.el itself - which would of course
require consent of the remember.el maintainers.  I am not
sure how well this would work though, since some things like
the interactive time stamps are org.el specific, so treating
them would require special hooks.  Comments?
