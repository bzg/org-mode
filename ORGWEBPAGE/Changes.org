** Incompatible Changes

*** Changes to the intended use of =org-export-latex-classes=

So far this variable has been used to specify the complete header
of the LaTeX document, including all the =\usepackage= calls
necessary for the document.  This setup makes it difficult to
maintain the list of packages that Org itself would like to call,
for example for the special symbol support it needs.  Each time I
have to add a package, I have to ask people to revise the
configuration of this variable.  In this release, I have tried to
fix this.

First of all, you can *opt out of this change* in the following
way: You can say: /I want to have full control over headers, and
I will take responsibility to include the packages Org needs/.
If that is what you want, add this to your configuration and skip
the rest of this section (except maybe for the description of the
=[EXTRA]= place holder):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-export-latex-default-packages-alist nil
        org-export-latex-packages-alist nil)
#+end_src

/Continue to read here if you want to go along with the modified
setup./

There are now two variables that should be used to list the LaTeX
packages that need to be included in all classes.  The header
definition in =org-export-latex-classes= should then not contain
the corresponding =\usepackage= calls (see below).

The two new variables are:

1. =org-export-latex-default-packages-alist= :: This is the
     variable where Org-mode itself puts the packages it needs.
     Normally you should not change this variable.  The only
     reason to change it anyway is when one of these packages
     causes a conflict with another package you want to use.
     Then you can remove that packages and hope that you are not
     using Org-mode functionality that needs it.

2. =org-export-latex-packages-alist= :: This is the variable
     where you can put the packages that you'd like to use across
     all classes.  For example, I am putting =amsmath= and =tikz=
     here, because I always want to have them.

The sequence how these customizations will show up in the LaTeX
document are:
1. Header from =org-export-latex-classes=
2. =org-export-latex-default-packages-alist=
3. =org-export-latex-packages-alist=
4. Buffer-specific things set with =#+LaTeX_HEADER:=

If you want more control about which segment is placed where, or
if you want, for a specific class, have full control over the
header and exclude some of the automatic building blocks, you can
put the following macro-like place holders into the header:

#+begin_example
[DEFAULT-PACKAGES]      \usepackage statements for default packages
[NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES]   do not include any of the default packages
[PACKAGES]              \usepackage statements for packages 
[NO-PACKAGES]           do not include the packages
[EXTRA]                 the stuff from #+LaTeX_HEADER
[NO-EXTRA]              do not include #+LaTeX_HEADER stuff
#+end_example

If you have currently customized =org-export-latex-classes=, you
should revise that customization and remove any package calls that
are covered by =org-export-latex-default-packages-alist=.  This
applies to the following packages:

- inputenc
- fontenc
- fixltx2e
- graphicx
- longtable
- float
- wrapfig
- soul
- t1enc
- textcomp
- marvosym
- wasysym
- latexsym
- amssymb
- hyperref
- microtype

If one of these packages creates a conflict with another package
you are using, you can remove it from
=org-export-latex-default-packages-alist=.  But then you risk
that some of the advertised export features of Org will not work
properly.

You can also consider moving packages that you use in all classes
to =org-export-latex-packages-alist=.  If necessary, put the
place holders so that the packages get loaded in the right
sequence.  As said above, for backward compatibility, if you omit
the place holders, all the variables will dump their content at
the end of the header.

Damn, this has become more complex than I wanted it to be.  I
hope that in practice, this will not be complicated at all.

*** The constant =org-html-entities= is obsolete

Its content is now part of the new constant =org-entities=, which
is defined in the file org-entities.el.  =org-html-entities= was
an internal variable, but it is possible that some users did
write code using it - this is why I am mentioning it here.

** Editing Convenience and Appearance

*** New faces for title, date, author and email address lines.
    
The keywords in these lines are now dimmed out, and the title is
displayed in a larger font, and a special font is also used for
author, date, and email information.  This is implemented by the
following new faces:
    
org-document-title
org-document-info
org-document-info-keyword
    
In addition, the variable =org-hidden-keywords= can be used to
make the corresponding keywords disappear.

Thanks to Dan Davison for this feature.

*** Simpler way to specify faces for tags and todo keywords
    
The variables =org-todo-keyword-faces=, =org-tag-faces=, and
=org-priority-faces= now accept simple color names as
specifications.  The colors will be used as either foreground or
background color for the corresponding keyword.  See also the
variable =org-faces-easy-properties=, which governs which face
property is affected by this setting.

This is really a great simplification for setting keyword faces.
The change is based on an idea and patch by Ryan Thompson.

*** <N> in tables now means fixed width, not maximum width
    
Requested by Michael Brand.

*** Better level cycling function

=TAB= in an empty headline cycles the level of that headline
through likely states.  Ryan Thompson implemented an improved
version of this function, which does not depend upon when exactly
this command is used.  Thanks to Ryan for this improvement.

*** Adaptive filling
    
For paragraph text, =org-adaptive-fill-function= did not handle the
base case of regular text which needed to be filled.  This is now
fixed.  Among other things, it allows email-style ">" comments
to be filled correctly.

Thanks to Dan Hackney for this patch.    

*** `org-reveal' (=C-c C-r=) also decrypts encrypted entries (org-crypt.el)
    
Thanks to Richard Riley for triggering this change.

*** Better automatic letter selection for TODO keywords
    
When all first letters of keywords have been used, Org now assigns
more meaningful characters based on the keywords.

Thanks to Mikael Fornius for this patch.

** Export

*** Much better handling of entities for LaTeX export

Special entities like =\therefore= and =\alpha= now know if
they need to be in LaTeX math mode and are formatted accordingly.

Thanks to Ulf Stegemann for the tedious work to make this
possible.
    
*** LaTeX export: Set coding system automatically

The coding system of the LaTeX class will now be set to the value
corresponding to the buffer's file coding system.  This happens
if your setup sets up the file to have a line
=\usepackage[AUTO]{inputenc}= (the default setup does this).

*** New exporters to Latin-1 and UTF-8

While Ulf Stegemann was going through the entities list to
improve the LaTeX export, he had the great idea to provide
representations for many of the entities in Latin-1, and for all
of them in UTF-8.  This means that we can now export files rich
in special symbols to Latin-1 and to UTF-8 files.  These new
exporters can be reached with the commands =C-c C-e n= and =C-c
C-e u=, respectively.

When there is no representation for a given symbol in the
targeted coding system, you can choose to keep the TeX-macro-like
representation, or to get an "explanatory" representation.  For
example, =\simeq= could be represented as "[approx. equal to]".
Please use the variable =org-entities-ascii-explanatory= to state
your preference.

*** Full label/reference support in HTML, Docbook, and LaTeX backends

=#+LABEL= definitions for tables and figures are now fully
implemented in the LaTeX, Docbook, and HTML interfaces.
=\ref{xxx}= is expanded to a valid link in all backends.

*** BEAMER export: Title of the outline frame is now customizable
    
The new option =org-outline-frame-title= allows to set the 
title for outline frames in Beamer presentations.

Patch by Lukasz Stelmach.
    
*** BEAMER export: fragile frames are better recognized

A =lstlisting= environment now also triggers the fragile option in
a beamer frame, just like =verbatim= environments do.

Thanks to Eric Schulte for this patch.

*** BEAMER export: Protect <...> macro arguments

Macros for the BEAMER package can have arguments in angular
brackets.  These are now protected just like normal arguments.

Requested by Bill Jackson.

*** HTML export: Add class to outline containers using property
    
The =HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS= property can now be used to add a
class name to the outline container of a node in HTML export.

*** New option =org-export-email-info= to turn off export of the email address
    
Default is actually off now.

*** Throw an error when creating an image from a LaTeX snippet fails

This behavior can be configured with the new option variable
=org-format-latex-signal-error=.

** Index generation
    
Org-mode can now produce a 2-level subject index spanning an
entire publishing project.  Write index entries in your files as

#+begin_src org
,* What is org-mode?
#+index: Org-mode
#+index: Definitions!Org-mode
#+end_src

where the first line will produce an index entry /Org-mode/,
while the second line will create /Definitions/ with a sub-item
/Org-mode/.  Three-level entries are not supported.

To produce the index, set

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
:makeindex t
#+end_src

in the project definition in =org-publish-project-alist=.  You
may have to force re-export of all files to get the index by
using a =C-u= prefix to the publishing command:

#+begin_example
C-u M-x org-publish-all
#+end_example

Whenever an Org file is published in this project, a new file
with the extension "orgx" will be written.  It contains the index
entries and corresponding jump target names.  When all project
files are published, Org will produce a new file "theindex.inc"
containing the index as a to-level tree.  This file can be
included into any project file using

#+begin_src org
  ,#+include: "theindex.inc"
#+end_src

Org-mode will also create a file "theindex.org" with this include
statement, and you can build a more complex structure (for
example style definitions, top and home links, etc) around this
statement.  When this file already exists, it will not be
overwritten by Org.

Thanks to Stefan Vollmar for initiating and driving this feature.

*** TODO Still need to do the LaTeX portion

** MobileOrg

*** Encrypting stage files for MobileOrg

Since the use of (often pubic) servers is needed for MobileOrg,
it is now possible to encrypt the files to be staged for
MobileOrg.  Version 1.2 of MobileOrg will be needed for this
feature, and Richard Moreland will show instructions on his
website once that is available.  Basically, on the Org-side this
will require the following settings:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-mobile-use-encryption t
        org-mobile-encryption-password "My_MobileOrg_Password")
#+end_src

So the password will be visible in your local setup, but since
the encryption is only for the public server, this seems
acceptable.

** Agenda

*** Specify entry types as an option
    
Custom Agenda commands can now limit the sets of entry types
considered for this command by binding =org-agenda-entry-types=
temporarily in the options section of the command.  This can lead
to significant speedups, because instead of laboriously finding
entries and then rejecting them, a whole search cycle is skipped.
For more information see the new section in
[[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-custom-agenda-commands.php#sec-5][Matt Lundin's agenda custom command tutorial]].

Thanks to Matt Lundin for this feature.

*** Speed up multiple calls to org-diary by only doing buffer prep once
    
Also a patch by Matt Lundin.

*** Show and hide deadlines in the agenda

You can now hide all deadline entries in the agenda by pressing
=!=.

Thanks to John Wiegley for this feature.

*** Agenda: Allow to suppress deadline warnings for entries also scheduled

The the docstring of the variable
=org-agenda-skip-deadline-prewarning-if-scheduled=.

*** Expand file names in org-agenda-files (external file case)
    
If you are using a file to manage the list of agenda files, the
names in this file can now contain environment variables and "~"
to write them more compactly and portable.

Thanks to Mikael Fornius for a patch to this effect.

*** Agenda: Allow TODO conditions in the skip functions

The agenda skip function has now special support for skipping
based on the TODO state.  Here are just two examples, see the
manual for more information.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'todo '(\"TODO\" \"WAITING\"))
(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'nottodo 'done)
#+end_src

Thanks to Lukasz Stelmach for this patch.

*** Extracting the time-of-day when adding diary entries

The time of day can now be extracted from new diary entries made
from the agenda with (for example) =i d=.  When
=org-agenda-insert-diary-extract-time= is set, this is done, and
the time is moved into the time stamp.

Thanks to Stephen Eglen for this feature.

*** The customization group org-font-lock has been renamed

The new name is `org-appearance'.

Thanks to Dan Davison for a patch to this effect.

*** The TODO list: Allow skipping scheduled or deadlined entries

Skipping TODO entries in the global TODO list based on whether
they are scheduled or have a deadline can now be controlled in
more detail.  Please see the docstrings of
=org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled= and
=org-agenda-todo-ignore-deadline=.

Thanks to Lukasz Stelmach for patches to this effect.

** Hyperlinks

*** Make =org-store-link= point to directory in a dired buffer
    
When, in a dired buffer, the cursor is not in a line listing a
file, `org-store-link' will store a link to the directory.

Patch by Stephen Eglen.

*** Allow regexps in =org-file-apps= to capture link parameters
    
The way extension regexps in =org-file-apps= are handled has
changed.  Instead of matching against the file name, the regexps
are now matched against the whole link, and you can use grouping
to extract link parameters which you can then use in a command
string to be executed.

For example, to allow linking to PDF files using the syntax
=file:/doc.pdf::<page number>=, you can add the following entry to
org-file-apps:

#+begin_example
Extension: \.pdf::\([0-9]+\)\'
Command:   evince "%s" -p %1
#+end_example

Thanks to Jan Böker for a patch to this effect.

** Clocking

*** Show clock overruns in mode line

When clocking an item with a planned effort, overrunning the
planned time is now made visible in the mode line, for example
using the new face =org-mode-line-clock-overrun=, or by adding an
extra string given by =org-task-overrun-text=.

Thanks to Richard Riley for a patch to this effect.

** Tables

*** Repair the broken support for table.el tables again.
    
Tables created with the table.el package now finally work again
in Org-mode.  While you cannot edit the table directly in the
buffer, you can use  =C-c '= to edit it nicely in a temporary
buffer.

Export of these tables to HTML seem to work without problems.
Export to LaTeX is imperfect.  If fails if the table contains
special characters that will be replaced by the exporter before
formatting the table.  The replacement operation changes the
length of some lines, breaking the alignment of the table fields.
Unfortunately this is not easy to fix.  It is also not an option
to not do these replacements.  The table.el LaTeX exporter will
for example not escape "&" in table fields, causing the exported
tables to be broken.

** Misc

*** New logging support for refiling

Whenever you refile an item, a time stamp and even a note can be
added to this entry.  For details, see the new option
=org-log-refile=.
    
Thanks to Charles Cave for this idea.

*** New helper functions in org-table.el

There are new functions to access and write to a specific table
field.  This is for hackers, and maybe for the org-babel people.

#+begin_example
org-table-get
org-table-put
org-table-current-line
org-table-goto-line
#+end_example

*** Tables: Field coordinates for formulas, and improved docs
    
Calc and Emacs-Lisp formulas for tables can access the current
field coordinates with =@#= and =$#= for row and column,
respectively.  These can be useful in some formulas.  For
example, to sequentially number the fields in a column, use
~=@#~ as column equation.

One application is to copy a column from a different table.  See
the manual for details.

Thanks to Michael Brand for this feature.

*** Archiving: Allow to reverse order in target node
    
The new option =org-archive-reversed-order= allows to have
archived entries inserted in a last-on-top fashion in the target
node.
    
Requested by Tom.

*** Better documentation on calc accuracy in tables
    
Thanks to Michael Brand for this fix.

*** Clock reports can now include the running, incomplete clock

If you have a clock running, and the entry being clocked falls
into the scope when creating a clock table, the time so far spent
can be added to the total.  This behavior depends on the setting
of =org-clock-report-include-clocking-task=.  The default is
=nil=.
    
Thanks to Bernt Hansen for this useful addition.

*** American-style dates are now understood by =org-read-date=

So when you are prompted for a date, you can now answer like this

#+begin_example
2/5/3         --> 2003-02-05
2/5           --> <CURRENT-YEAR>-02-05
#+end_example    

*** org-timer.el now allows just one timer

There is now only a single free timer supported by org-timer.el.
Thanks to Bastien for cleaning this up, after a bug report in
this area by Frédéric Couchet.

*** Remember: Allow to file as sibling of current clock
    
=C-3 C-c C-c= will file the remember entry as a sibling of the
last filed entry.

Patch by Lukasz Stelmach.

*** Org-reveal: Double prefix arg shows the entire subtree of the parent
    
This can help to get out of an inconsistent state produced for
example by viewing from the agenda.

This was a request by Matt Lundin.

*** Add org-secretary.el by Juan Reyero to the contrib directory

org-secretary.el is a possible setup for group work using
Org-mode.

Thanks to Juan Reyero for this contribution.

** Babel

Eric and Dan have compiled the following list of changes in and
around org-babel.

- Added support for Matlab and Octave.
- Added support for C and C++ code blocks.
- Added support for the Oz programming language.
  Thanks to Torsten Anders for this contribution
- Can now force literal interpretation of table cell contents
  with extra "$" in table formula.
  Thanks to Maurizio Vitale for this suggestion.
- Variable references which look like lisp forms are now
  evaluated.
- No longer adding extension during tangling when filename is
  provided.
  Thanks to Martin G. Skjæveland and Nicolas Girard for prompting this.
- Added `org-babel-execute-hook' which runs after code block
  execution.
- Working directories and remote execution

  This introduces a new header argument :dir. For the duration of
  source block execution, default-directory is set to the value
  of this header argument. Consequences include:

  - external interpreter processes run in that directory
  - new session processes run in that directory (but existing
    ones are unaffected)
  - relative paths for file output are relative to that directory

  The name of a directory on a remote machine may be specified
  with tramp syntax (/user@host:path), in which case the
  interpreter executable will be sought in tramp-remote-path, and
  if found will execute on the remote machine in the specified
  remote directory.
- Tramp syntax can be used to tangle to remote files.
  Thanks to Maurizio Vitale and Rémi Vanicat.
- org-R removed from contrib.
- gnuplot can now return it's string output -- when session is
  set to "none".
- Now including source code block arguments w/source name on
  export.
- Now able to reference file links as results.
- Allow pdf/png generation directly from latex source blocks
  with :file header argument.


* Version 6.34
 :PROPERTIES:
 :CUSTOM_ID: v6.34
 :END:

** Incompatible changes

*** Tags in org-agenda-auto-exclude-function must be lower case.

When defining an =org-agenda-auto-exclude-function=, you need to
be aware that tag that is being passed into the function is
always lower case - even if it was defined in upper case
originally.

** Details

*** Support for creating BEAMER presentations from Org-mode documents

Org-mode documents or subtrees can now be converted directly in
to BEAMER presentation.  Turning a tree into a simple
presentations is straight forward, and there is also quite some
support to make richer presentations as well.  See the [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Beamer-class-export.html#Beamer-class-export][BEAMER
section]] in the manual for more details.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the discussion about
BEAMER support and how it should work.  This was a great example
for how this community can achieve a much better result than any
individual could.

*** Hyperlinks

**** Add Paul Sexton's org-ctags.el

Targets like =<<my target>>= can now be found by Emacs' etag
functionality, and Org-mode links can be used to to link to
etags, also in non-Org-mode files.  For details, see the file
/org-ctags.el/.

This feature uses a new hook =org-open-link-functions= which will
call function to do something special with text links.

Thanks to Paul Sexton for this contribution.

**** Add Jan Böker's org-docview.el

This new module allows links to various file types using docview,
where Emacs displays images of document pages.  Docview link
types can point to a specific page in a document, for example to
page 131 of the Org-mode manual:

: [[docview:~/.elisp/org/doc/org.pdf::131][Org-Mode Manual]]

Thanks to Jan Böker for this contribution.
    
**** New link types that force special ways of opening the file
    
- =file+sys:/path/to/file=  will use the system to open the file,
  like double-clicking would.
- file+emacs:/path/to/file will force opening the linked file
  with Emacs.

This was a request by John Wiegley.

**** Open all links in a node

When using =C-c C-o= on a headline to get a list of links in the
entry, pressing =RET= will open *all* links.  This allows
something like projects to be defined, with a number of files
that have to be opened by different applications.

This was a request by John Wiegley.

*** Agenda Views

**** Improve the logic of the search view.

The logic of search views is changed a bit.  See the docstring of
the function =or-search-view=.

These changes resulted from a discussion with Matt Lundin.

**** New face for entries from the Emacs diary

Entries that enter the Agenda through the Emacs diary now get the
face =org-agenda-diary=.

This was a request by Thierry Volpiatto.

**** New function `org-diary-class' to schedule classes with skipped weeks.

This was a request by Daniel Martins.

**** Empty matcher means prompt in agenda custom commands
    
When an agenda custom command has an empty string as MATCH
element, so far this would lead to a meaningless search using an
empty matcher.  Now an empty (or white) string will be
interpreted just like a nil matcher, i.e. the user will be
prompted for the match.

**** Agenda: Selectively remove some tags from agenda display

If you use tags very extensively, you might want to exclude some
from being displayed in the agenda, in order to keep the display
compact.  See the new option =org-agenda-hide-tags-regexp= for
details.
    
This was largely a patch by Martin Pohlack.

*** Export

**** Direct export of only the current subtree

Pressing =1= after =C-c C-e= and before the key that selects the
export backend, only the current subtree will be exported,
exactly as it you had selected it first with =C-c @=.  So for
example, =C-c C-e 1 b= will export the current subtree to HTML
and open the result in the browser.

**** Direct export of enclosing node

Pressing =SPC= after =C-c C-e= and before the key that selects
the export backend, the enclosing subree that is set up for
subtree export will be exported, exactly as it you had selected
it first with =C-c @=.  So for example, =C-c C-e SPC d= will find
the enclosing node with a LaTeX_CLASS property or an
EXPORT_FILE_NAME property and export that.

**** Caching export images

Images that are created for example using LaTeX or ditaa for
inclusion into exported files are now cached.  This works by
adding a hash to the image name, that reflects the source code
and all relevant settings.  So as long as the hash does not
change, the image does not have to be made again.  His can lead
to a substantial reduction in export/publishing times.

Thanks to Eric Schulte for a patch to this effect.

**** Preserving line breaks for export no longer works
    
ASCII export always preserves them - no other export format
does.  We had attempted to use =\obeylines= for this in LaTeX,
but that does create too many problems.

**** New symbols =\EUR= and =\checkmark=

=\EUR= symbols from Marvosym package, and =\checkmark= are now
supported symbols in Org-mode, i.e. they will be exported
properly to the various backends.

**** Allow LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS to set options, also from a property

You can set the options to the =\documentclass= command on a
per-file basis, using

: #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [11pt]

or on a per-tree basis using the corresponding property.  The
defined string will replace the default options entirely.

**** The encoding of LaTeX files is now handled property

Org now makes sure that the encoding used by the file created
through the export mechanism is reflected correctly in the

: \usepackage[CODINGSYSTEM]{inputenc}

command.  So as long as the =org-export-latex-classes= definition
contains an =\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}= statement, that
statement will be modified so that the correct option is used.

If you wan to use special encodings, for example =utf8x= instead
of =utf8=, see the variable =org-export-latex-inputenc-alist=.

This was a request by Francesco Pizzolante.

*** Property API enhancements
    
**** Make a new special property BLOCKED, indicating if entry is blocked

A new special property BLOCKED returns "t" when the entry is
blocked from switching the TODO state to a DONE state.

This was a request by John Wiegley.

**** New hooks for external support for allowed property values

It is now possible to hook into Org in order to provide the
allowed values for any property with a lisp function.  See the
docstring of the variable =org-property-allowed-value-functions=

**** Allow unrestricted completion on properties

When listing the allowed values for a property, for example with
a =:name_ALL:= property, completion on these values enforces that
one of the values will be chosen.  Now, if you add ":ETC" to the
list of allowed values, it will be interpreted as a switch, and
the completion will be non-restrictive, so you can also choose to
type a new value.

*** Changes to Org-babel

- The documentation for Org-babel has been drastically improved
  and is available on Worg at
  http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/
- Source-code block names are now exported to HTML and LaTeX
- Org-babel functions are now bound to keys behind a common key
  prefix (see
  http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/reference.php#sec-5)
- Results are now foldable with TAB
- Header argument values can now be lisp forms
- Readable aliases for #+srcname: and #+resname:
- Sha1 hash based caching of results in buffer
- Can now index into variable values
- org-babel-clojure now supports multiple named sessions

*** Miscellaneous changes

**** Make =C-c r C= customize remember templates

=C-c r C= is now a shortcut for

:  M-x customize-variable RET org-remember-templates RET

This was a proposal by Adam Spiers.

**** Use John Gruber's regular expression for URL's

We now use a better regexp to spot plain links in text.  This
regexp is adopted from [[http://daringfireball.net/2009/11/liberal_regex_for_matching_urls][John Gruber's blogpost]].

Thanks to William Henney for the pointer.

**** Implement tag completion of all tags in all agenda files
    
The new option =org-complete-tags-always-offer-all-agenda-tags=
makes Org complete all tags from all agenda files if non-nil.
Usually, setting it locally to t in org-remember buffers is the
most useful application of this new feature.

Thanks to Tassilo Horn for a patch to this effect.

*** Reorganize key bindings for archiving
    
The following keys now do archiving

- C-c C-x C-a :: archive using the command specified in
     =org-archive-default-command=.  This variable is by default
     set to =org-archive-subtree=, which means arching to the
     archive file.
    
The three specific archiving commands are available through

- C-c C-x C-s ::    archive to archive file
- C-c C-x a ::     toggle the archive tag
- C-c C-x A ::   move to archive sibling

These bindings work the same in an Org file, and in the agenda.

In addition:
    
- In the agenda you can also use =a= to call the default archiving
  command, but you need to confirm the command with =y= so that this
  cannot easily happen by accident.
  
- For backward compatibility, =C-c $= in an org-mode file, and
  =$= in the agenda buffer continue to archive to archive file.


** Details

*** Level indentation cycling new empty entries and plain list items
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: 1CBF16C9-031C-4A03-A5EE-09B6AAB6209C
:END:

To speed up data entry, TAB now behaves special in an empty
headline, i.e. if the current line only contains the headline
starter stars, maybe a TOD keyword, but no further content.  This
is usually the situation just after creating a new headline with
=M-RET= or =M-S-RET=.

Then, TAB will first make the current entry a child of the
entry above, then a parent, then a grand parent etc until it
reaches top level.  Yet another TAB and you will be back at the
initial level at which the headline was created.

New plain list items behave in just the same way.

Sounds strange?  Try it, it is insanely fast when entering data.
If you still don't like it, turn it off by customizing
=org-cycle-level-after-item/entry-creation=.

Thanks to [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/18236][Samuel Wales]] and [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/18447/focus%3D19015][John Wiegley]] for ideas that
contributed to this new feature.

*** Speed commands at the start of a headline

If you set the variable =org-use-speed-commands=, the cursor
position at the beginning of a headline (i.e. before the first
star) becomes special.  Single keys execute special commands in
this place, for example outline navigation with =f=, =b=, =n=,
and =p=, equivalent to the corresponding =C-c C-f=, =C-c C-b=,
=C-c C-n=, and =C-c C-f= commands.  The full list of commands can
be seen by pressing =?= at the special location.  More commands
can be added and existing ones modified by configuring the
variable =org-speed-commands-user=.

This was a request by John Wiegley, based on similar speed
navigation in /allout.el/.

*** Logging changes in scheduling and deadline time stamps

Setting the variables =org-log-reschedule= and
=org-log-redeadline= to either =time= or =note= will arrange for
recording a logbook entry whenever a scheduling date or deadline
is changed.

This was a request by Rick Moynihan.

*** File remember notes into a date tree

Remember notes can now be filed to a location in a date tree.  A
date tree is an outline tree with years as top levels, months as
level 2 headings, and days as level three headings.  These are
great for journals and for recording appointments and other loose
dates because it will be easy to find all entries referencing a
particular date, and it will be easy to archive all such entry
from last year, for example.

To select date tree filing, set the HEADLINE part of the remember
template to the symbol =date-tree=.  The date tree will be build
in the file on top level.  However, if the file contains an entry
with a non-nil =DATE_TREE= property, then the tree will be build
under that headline.

*** New commands to create entries from agenda and calendar

If you make the variable =org-agenda-diary-file= point to an
org-mode file, the =i= key in both the agenda buffer and in the
Emacs calendar will be made to insert entries into that Org file.
The dates at the cursor and the mark are being used when making
entries for specific dates or blocks.  In the new file,
anniversaries will be collected under a special headline, and
day/block entries will be filed into a date tree (see previous
section).

This was a request by Stephen Eglen.

*** A new freemind exporter has been integrated with Org-mode

org-freemind.el has a number of entry points (for details, see
the source code), but you can also use Org's =C-c C-e m= to
export a file or a selected subtree.

Thanks to Lennart Borgman for this contribution.  An earlier
version of this file was part of the nxhtml package, under the
name /freemind.el/.

*** Drawers are now exported properly

Drawers are now exported when the configuration requires it,
i.e. if the variable `org-export-with-drawers' is t or a list
containing the drawers to export.

*** Min/Max/Mean age operators in Column View.
    
This lets you see how much time has passed since the specified
timestamp property each entry. The three operators (=@min=,
=@max=, =@mean=) show either the age of the youngest or oldest
entry or the average age of the children.

Thanks to James TD Smith for a patch to this effect.
    
*** Allow source code block indentation to be preserved
    
If =org-src-preserve-indentation= is non-nil, or if a block has a
=-i= switch, then the behavior of org-exp-blocks is altered as
follows:

1. Indentation is not removed before passing the block contents
   to the block-transforming plugin.
   
2. The result returned by the plugin is not re-indented.

3. Editing the source code block with =C-c '= preserves it's
   indentation.

Thanks to Dan Davison for this feature.

*** Frame/window control when switching to source code edit buffer.
    
When switching to a source code editing buffer with =C-c '=, you
can now control the frame / window setup using the new variable
=org-src-window-setup=.

Thanks to Dan Davison for this feature.

*** Refile an entry to the current clock

You can now quickly refile an entry to become a child of the
entry currently being clocked.  The keys for doing this are
=C-2 C-c C-w=.

This was a request by Bernt Hansen.

*** Make =C-c C-o= open the attachment directory is there are no links

If there is no link in an entry, =C-c C-o= will now open the
attachment directory instead.

This was a request/patch by John Wiegley.

*** org-mac-iCal.el: work with calendar "groups"
    
Some calendar systems (Google, Zimbra) handle subscriptions to
multiple calendars (or to an account) by grouping them under a
single caldav directory in the calendar tree.  org-mac-iCal used
to assumes there is only one ics file created per caldav
directory, so while it *creates* all of the needed merged ics
files, it only copies one of them to ~/Library/Calendar before
importing the contents into the diary.

Thanks to Doug Hellmann for a patch to fix this.

*** New module /org-learn.el/ in the contrib directory

The file implements the learning algorithm described at
http://supermemo.com/english/ol/sm5.htm, which is a system for reading
material according to "spaced repetition".  See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition for more details.

Thanks to John Wiegley for this contribution.

*** New contributed package /org-git-link.el/

/org-git-link.el/ defines two new link types. The =git= link type
is meant to be used in the typical scenario and mimics the =file=
link syntax as closely as possible.  The =gitbare= link type
exists mostly for debugging reasons, but also allows e.g.
linking to files in a bare git repository for the experts.

Thanks to Raimar Finken for this contribution.

*** /org-annotation-helper.el/ and /org-browser-url.e./ have been removed
Please switch to /org-protocol.el/, into which contains the same
functionality in a more general framework.
*** The contributed /org-export-freemind/ package has been removed.
Org now contains a new freemind exporter, /org-freemind.el/.

** Org-babel Changes
- Clojure is supported [Thanks to Joel Boehland]
- Perl is supported
- Ruby and Python now respond to the :file header argument
- Added :results_switches header argument for passing switches
  through to raw src blocks
- Preserve indentation in source blocks on export and tangle
- Possible to evaluate noweb reference on tangling or code block
  evaluation
- Allowing multiple noweb references on a single line
- Cleaned up the passing of parameter values from Org-babel to
  language specific functions

* Version 6.32
 :PROPERTIES:
 :CUSTOM_ID: v6.32
 :END:

** Rewrite of org-mobile.org, for MobileOrg 1.0 (build 20)

MobileOrg is currently under review at the iPhone App Store.  You
will need Org-mode version 6.32 to interact with it.

** Added support for habit consistency tracking
    
/org-habit.el/ contains new code to track habits.  Please
configure the variable org-modules to activate it.  When active,
habits (a special TODO entry) will be displayed in the agenda
together with a "consistency graph".  Habit tracking is described
in a new [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Tracking-your-habits.html][manual section]].

Thanks to John Wiegley for this contribution.
    
** New context-aware tag auto-exclusion 

After writing a function relating to location and context
information, you will be able to press =/ RET= in the agenda to
exclude tasks that cannot be done in the current context. 
For details, see the information about filtering in the manual.

Thanks to John Wiegley for a patch to this effect.

** New clock resolving tools

When clocking into a new task while no clock is running, Org now
checks for orphaned CLOCK lines and offers to repair these before
starting the clock.  You can also configure this feature to check
for idle time and prompt you to subtract that time from the
running timer.
    
See the new [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Resolving-idle-time.html][manual section]] for more details.
    
Thanks to John Wiegley for a patch to this effect.

** Mutually exclusive tag groups can now have a name in the tags interface

The customize interface allows to optionally add a string to the
beginning or end of such a group.
    
Thanks to James TD Smith for a patch to this effect.

** Agenda Search view: Search for substrings
    
The default in search view (/C-c a s/)is now that the search
expression is searched for as a /substring/, i.e. the different
words must occur in direct sequence, and it may be only part of
a word.  If you want to look for a number of separate keywords
with Boolean logic, all words must be preceded by =+= or =-=.

This was, more-or-less, requested by John Wiegley.

** Make space and backspace scroll the show window in the agenda

Pressing SPC again after using it to show an agenda item in
another window will make the entire subtree visible, and show
scroll it.  Backspace and DEL will scroll back.

This was a request by Eric Fraga.
    
** File tags are now offered for completion during a tag prompts

Requested by Matt Lundin.

** Make `- SPC' an agenda filter that selects entries without any tags
    
Request by John Wiegley.

** Better way to edit multi-line macro definitions

The editing tool key =C-c '= now also edits =#+MACRO=
definitions, including multiline macros.

** Restructured Manual

The manual has been slightly reorganized.  The archiving stuff,
which was - somewhat obscurely - hidden in the /Document
Structure/ chapter, has been moved into the new chapter
/Capture-Refile-Archive/.  Also, there is a new chapter /Markup/
which contains both the markup rules (moved there from the Export
chapter) and the documentation for embedded LaTeX.

** Improved figure placement in LaTeX and HTML export
    
Text can now be wrapped around figures.  See the manual for
details.

** Allow date to be shifted into the future if time given is earlier than now
    
By setting

:     (setq org-read-date-prefer-future 'time)

you indicate to Org that, if you only give a time at the
date/time prompt, and if this time is earlier then the current
time, then the date of tomorrow will be assumed to be valid for
this event.  A similar mechanism was already in place for dates,
but now you can make it work for times as well.

** Collected changes in org-babel
- Source blocks can now reference source-blocks in other files
  using =filepath:srcname= syntax.
- Inline code blocks like =src_python{2+2}= are now exported
- Remote source block calls using the =#+lob: srcname(arg=val)=
  syntax can now be exported.
- When =:file= is supplied with an =R= block, graphics are
  automatically sent to file and linked from the org buffer, thus
  appearing on export.  The image format is obtained from the
  filename extension.  Possible values are =.png, .jpg, .jpeg,
  .tiff, .bmp, .pdf, .ps, .postscript=, defaulting to =png=.
- Results can be returned as parseable code using =:results code=,
  and as pretty-printed code using =:results pp= (emacs-lisp,
  python, ruby).  Thanks to Benny Andresen for the idea and patch
  for emacs-lisp.
- When =:file filename= is supplied, =:exports file= is unnecessary
- Header args are taken from org-file-properties in addition to
  properties active in the subtree.
- =:noweb= header argument now expands noweb references before
  source-block evaluation.
- Tangling honours the new org variable
  org-src-preserve-indentation, so that correct code is output for
  a language like python that depends on indentation.

** Changes in org-exp-blocks.el
- Interblocks export has been simplified.
- Support for R code (=begin_R= blocks and inline =\R{}=) has been
  removed.  Please use org-babel instead.

* Version 6.31
 :PROPERTIES:
 :CUSTOM_ID: v6.31
 :END:

** Org-babel is now part of the Org distribution

Org-babel provides the ability to execute source code in many
different languages within org-mode documents.  The results of
code execution -- text, tables and graphics -- can be integrated
into Org-mode documents and can be automatically updated during
publishing.  Since Org-babel allows execution of arbitrary code,
the range of tasks that can be addressed from within an Org mode
file becomes very large.  Examples of ways in which Org-babel
might be used include

- Documenting a task that involves some programming so that it is
  automatically repeatable
- Creating dynamic (executable) reports that respond to changes
  in the underlying data (Reproducible Research)
- Exportation of code contained in an Org-mode document into
  regular source code files (Literate Programming)

Additionally, Org-babel provides a programming environment within
Org files, in which data can be transmitted between parameterised
source code blocks in different languages, as well as between
source code blocks and Org-mode tables.

A simple API is defined so that users can add support for new
"languages" (broadly construed).  Languages currently supported
are:

- asymptote
- css
- ditaa
- dot
- emacs-lisp
- gnuplot
- haskell
- ocaml
- python
- R
- ruby
- sass
- sh
- sql

Org-babel was designed and implemented Eric Schulte with continued
significant help on both accounts from Dan Davison.

** MobileOrg support

Richard Morelands iPhone/iPod Touch program [[http://mobileorg.ncogni.to/][MobileOrg]] can view
Org files, mark entries as DONE, flag entries for later
attention, and capture new entries on the road.  Org-mode has now
support to produce a staging area where MobileOrg can download
its files, and to integrate changes done on the phone in a half
automatic, half interactive way.  See the new appendix B in the
manual for more information.


** Indented lines starting with "#+ " are treated as comments

To allow comments in plain lists without breaking the list
structure, you can now have indented comment lines that start
with "#+ ".

** New STARTUP keyword `showeverything'
    
This will make even drawer contents visible upon startup.
Requested by Jeff Kowalczyk.

** New contributed package org-invoice.el

This package collects clocking information for billing
customers.

Thanks to Peter Jones for this contribution.

** Encrypting subtrees

/org-crypt.el/ by John Wiegley and Peter Jones allows encryption
of individual subtrees in Org-mode outlines.  Thanks to John and
Peter for this contribution.

** Agenda: Support for including a link in the category string
    
The category (as specified by an #+CATEGORY line or CATEGORY
property can contain a bracket link.  While this sort-of worked
in the past, it now is officially supported and should cause no
problems in agenda display or update.  The link can be followed
by clicking on it, or with =C-c C-o 0=.

This was a request by Peter Westlake.

* Version 6.30
 :PROPERTIES:
 :CUSTOM_ID: v6.30
 :END:

** Inconsistent changes

*** Agenda now uses =f= and =b= to move through time

Up to now, the Org-mode agenda used the cursor keys =left= and
=right= to switch the agenda view forward an backward through
time.  However, many people found this confusing, and others
wanted to be able to do cursor motion in the agenda, for example
to select text.  Therefore, after an extensive discussion on
=emacs-orgmode@gnu.org=, it was decided to use the =b= and 
=f= keys instead, and to let the cursor keys do cursor motion
again.

*** Agenda follow mode is now on the =F= key

This was necessary to free up the =f= key, see above.

** Details

*** Maintenance

**** New command to submit a bug report

There is now a special command =M-x org-submit-bug-report=.  This
command will create a mail buffer with lots of useful details.
In particular, it contains complete version information for Emacs
and Org-mode.  It will also (if you agree to it) contain all
non-standard settings of org-mode and outline-mode related
variables.  Even if you do not sent your emails from within
Emacs, please still use this command to generate the information
and then copy it into your mail program.

The command will not generate and include a =*Backtrace*= buffer,
please do this yourself if you have hit an error.  For more
information, see the [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Feedback.html#Feedback][feedback section]] of the manual.

**** New contributed package org-track.el

This package allows to keep up-to-date with current Org
development, using only Emacs on-board means.  So if you don't
want or cannot use =git=, but still want to run the latest and
hottest Org-mode, this is for you.

Thanks to Sebastian Rose for this contribution.

*** Agenda

**** Agenda now uses =f= and =b= to move through time

Up to now, the Org-mode agenda used the cursor keys =left= and
=right= to switch the agenda view forward an backward through
time.  However, many people found this confusing, and others
wanted to be able to do cursor motion in the agenda, for example
to select text.  Therefore, after an extensive discussion on
=emacs-orgmode@gnu.org=, it was decided to use the =b= and 
=f= keys instead, and to let the cursor keys do cursor motion
again.

**** Agenda follow mode is now on the =F= key

This was necessary to free up the =f= key, see above.

**** The agenda can be put into a dedicated frame

When the variable =org-agenda-window-setup= has the value
=other-frame=, then the new frame created to show the agenda
will now have the window marked as /dedicated/.  As a
consequence, exiting the agenda while the agenda is the only
window on the frame will kill that frame.

This was a request by Henry Atting.

**** New mode to show some entry body text in the agenda

There is now a new agenda sub-mode called
=org-agenda-entry-text-mode=.  It is toggled with the =E= key.
When active, all entries in the agenda will be accompanied by a
few lines from the outline entry.  The amount of text can be
customized with the variable =org-agenda-entry-text-maxlines=.

This was a request by Anthony Fairchild, Manish, and others.

**** Improve following links from the agenda
    
=C-c C-o= in the agenda will now offer all links in the headline
and text of an entry.  If there is only a single link, it will be
followed immediately.

**** Avoid some duplicate entries

There is a new variable that can be used to avoid some duplicate
agenda entries: =org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-deadline-is-shown=
If that is set, it avoids that an entry shows up in the agenda for
today for both a scheduling and a deadline entry.  See the
docstring of the variables for more details.

This partially addresses a request by Samuel Wales. 

**** Mark the running clock in the agenda.

If the entry currently being clocked is present in the agenda, it
will be highlighted with the face =org-agenda-clocking=.

This was a request by Rainer Stengele.


*** Export

**** Allow LaTeX export to use the listings package

The LaTeX =listings= package can now be used for formatting
fontified source code in many programming languages.  For more
information, see
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/16269 and
http://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.php#fontified_source_code_w_latex

Thanks to Eric Schulte for this patch.

**** Remove table rows that only contain width and alignment markers
    
The width and alignment in table columns can be set with a cookie
like "<10>" or "<r>" or "<r10>".  In order to keep Org from
exporting such lines, the first column of a line should contain
only "/".  However, for convenience, there is now a special case:
If the entire row contains only such markers, the line will
automatically be discarded during export, even is the first
column is not "/".

**** Allow Macro calls to span several lines.

Macro calls may now span several lines, to write several
arguments in a cleaner way.  The result of a macro call can also
span several lines, by inserting the string "\n" (backslash
followed by n) into the value in the macro definition.

These were requests by Stefan Vollmar.

*** Misc

**** Quick access to all links in an entry

If =C-c C-o= is called while the cursor is in a headline, but not
directly on a link, then all links in the entry will be offered
in a small menu.  If there is only a single link, it will be
followed without a prompt.

**** Visibility Cycling: Allow to show all empty lines after a headline
    
=org-cycle-separator-lines= can now be set to a negative value,
to indicate that, if the number of empty lines before a visible
entry is greater than the specified number, then *all* empty
lines should be shown.

This was a request by "PT" whatever this means.

**** Allow language names to replace some strange major mode names

Sometimes a language uses a major mode which can't be guessed
from it's name.  There is now a new variable =org-src-lang-modes=
which can be used to map language names to major modes when this
is the case.  This is used when editing a source-code 
block, or when exporting fontified source-code with htmlize.

Thanks to Eric Schulte for a patch to this effect.

**** iswitchb support for many completion prompts
    
This is enabled using =org-completion-use-iswitchb=, and follows
the same model of usage as for ido users.

Thanks to John Wiegley for a patch to this effect.

**** New commands to set the effort property of an entry

There is now a special command, =C-c C-x e= to set the =Effort=
property of an entry.  From the agenda you can even use =e=.
If you have set up allowed values for the =Effort= property, then
using a prefix argument will directly select the nth allowed
value.  For example, in the agenda, =5 e= will select the 5th
allowed value.

This was a request by Michael Gilbert

**** Edit src works now better with killing buffer

Thanks to Dan Davison for a patch to this effect
