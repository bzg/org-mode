*** org-choose.el by Tom Breton is now included

Org-choose helps documenting a decision-making process by using
TODO keywords for different degrees of /chosenness/, and by
automatically keeping a set of alternatives in a consistent state.

Documentation for /org-choose.el/ is available [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-choose.php][here]].

This package inserts itself into Org using hooks, so if other
people would like to do interesting stuff with TODO keywords for
special purposes, looking at Tom's code might be a good way to
start.

Thanks to Tom for this interesting contribution!

*** orgmode.org and Worg css works now better on IE

Thanks to Sebastian Rose for making these changes.

*** When exporting a subtree, headline levels are now relative to parent

This was reported as a bug by William Henney and is fixed now.

*** Inactive dates in tables can be used for sorting.

When sorting table fields or entries by date, Org first tries to
find an active date, and, if none exist, uses a passive date if
present.

This was a request by Hsui-Khuen Tang

*** The default for =org-return-follows-link= is back to =nil=

Setting it to =t= violates Emacs rules to some extent.  The
internal implementation of this has been improved, so setting it
to =t= should now be pretty stable.

*** Automatic scheduling of siblings with org-depend.el

The sibling of a DONE task can now automatically be scheduled.

This was a patch by Andrew Hyatt.

*** New skipping conditions

The functions =org-agenda-skip-entry-if= and
=org-agenda-skip-subtree-if= now accept =timestamp= and
=nottimestamp= as additional conditions.

This was in response to a request by Saurabh Agrawal.

* Version 6.21

** Details

*** Changes to some default values of variables:

Here are the new default values:

#+begin_example
(setq org-return-follows-link t)

(setq org-use-fast-todo-selection t)

(setq org-yank-adjusted-subtrees nil)

(setq org-tags-column -77)

(setq org-agenda-sorting-strategy
     '((agenda time-up priority-down category-keep)
	(todo time-up priority-down category-keep)
	(tags time-up priority-down category-keep)
	(search category-keep)))
#+end_example

*** Final cleanup for Emacs 21.1 pretest

* Version 6.20

** Details

*** Support for simple TODO dependencies

John Wiegley's code for enforcing simple TODO dependencies has
been integrated into Org-mode.  Thanks John!

The structure of Org files (hierarchy and lists) makes it easy to
define TODO dependencies.  A parent TODO task should not be
marked DONE until all subtasks (defined as children tasks) are
marked as DONE.  And sometimes there is a logical sequence to a
number of (sub)tasks, so that one task cannot be acted upon
before all siblings above it are done.  If you customize the
variable =org-enforce-todo-dependencies=, Org will block entries
from changing state while they have children that are not DONE.
Furthermore, if an entry has a property =ORDERED=, each of its
children will be blocked until all earlier siblings are marked
DONE.  Here is an example:

#+begin_src org
,* TODO Blocked until (two) is done
,** DONE one
,** TODO two

,* Parent
,  :PROPERTIES:
,    :ORDERED: t
,  :END:
,** TODO a
,** TODO b, needs to wait for (a)
,** TODO c, needs to wait for (a) and (b)
#+end_src

The command =C-c C-x o= toggles the value of the =ORDERED=
property.

The variable =org-agenda-dim-blocked-tasks= controls how blocked
entries should appear in the agenda, where they can be dimmed or
even made invisible.

Furthermore, you can use the variable
=org-enforce-todo-checkbox-dependencies= to block TODO entries
from switching to DONE while any checkboxes are unchecked in the entry.

*** Support for shift-selection in Emacs 23

Customize the variable =org-support-shift-select= to use S-cursor
key for selecting text.  Make sure that you carefully read the
docstring of that variable first.

*** Adding and removing checkboxes from many lines

The command =C-c C-x C-b= normally toggles checkbox status in the
current line, or in all lines in the region.  With prefix
argument it now either adds or removes the checkbox.

This was a requested by Daniel Clemente.

* Version 6.19

** Overview
   
- Improved behavior of conversion commands =C-c -= and =C-c *=
- Table formulas may now reference fields in other tables
- A final hline is imagined in each table, for the sake of references
- A tags-todo search can now ignore timestamped items
- =\par= can be used to force a paragraph break, also in footnotes

** Details
   

*** Improved behavior of conversion commands =C-c -= and =C-c *=

    The conversion commands =C-c -= and =C-c *= are now better
    behaved and therefore more useful, I hope.

    If there is an active region, these commands will act on the
    region, otherwise on the current line.

    - C-c - :: This command turns headings or normal lines into
         items, or items into normal lines.  When there is a
         region, everything depends on the first line of the
         region:
	 - if it is a item, turn all items in the region into
	   normal lines.
         - if it is a headline, turn all headlines in the region
	   into items. 
	 - if it is a normal line, turn all lines into items.
	 - special case: if there is no active region and the
	   current line is an item, cycle the bullet type of the
           current list.
    - C-c * :: This command turns items and normal lines into
         headings, or headings into normal lines.  When there is
         a region, everything depends on the first line of the
         region:
	 - if it is a item, turn all items in the region into
	   headlines.
         - if it is a headline, turn all headlines in the region
	   into normal lines. 
	 - if it is a normal line, turn all lines into headlines.

*** Table formulas may now reference fields in other tables

You may now reference constants, fields and ranges from a
different table, either in the current file or even in a
different file.  The syntax is

: remote(NAME-OR-ID,REF)

where /NAME/ can be the name of a table in the current file as
set by a =#+TBLNAME: NAME= line before the table.  It can also be
the ID of an entry, even in a different file, and the reference
then refers to the first table in that entry.  /REF/ is an
absolute field or range reference, valid in the referenced table.
Note that since there is no "current filed" for the remote table,
all row and column references must be absolute, not relative.

*** A final hline is imagined in each table, for the sake of references

Even if a table does not end with a hline (mine never do because I
think it is not pretty), for the sake of references you can
assume there is one.  So in the following table

#+begin_src org
| a | b |
|---+---|
| 1 | 2 |
| 3 | 4 |
#+end_src

a reference like =@I$1..@II$2= will now work.

*** A tags-todo search can now ignore timestamped items
    The variables =org-agenda-todo-ignore-with-date=,
    =org-agenda-todo-ignore-with-date=, and
    =org-agenda-todo-ignore-with-date= make it possible to
    exclude TODO entries which have this kind of planning info
    associated with them.  This is most useful for people who
    schedule everything, and who use the TODO list mainly to find
    things that are not yet scheduled.  Thomas Morgan pointed out
    that also the tags-todo search may serve exactly this
    purpose, and that it might be good to have a way to make
    these variables also apply to the tags-todo search.  I can
    see that, but could not convince myself to make this the
    default.  A new variable must be set to make this happen:
    =org-agenda-tags-todo-honor-ignore-options=.

*** =\par= can be used to force a paragraph break, also in footnotes

The LaTeX idiom =\par= will insert a paragraph break at that
location.  Normally you would simply leave an empty line to get
such a break, but this is useful for footnotes whose
definitions may not contain empty lines.

* Version 6.18
** Incompatible changes

*** Short examples must have a space after the colon

    Short literal examples can be created by preceding lines
    with a colon.  Such lines must now have a space after the
    colon.  I believe this is already general practice, but now
    it must be like this.  The only exception are lines what are
    empty except for the colon.    

** Details

*** Include files can now also process switches

    The example and src switches like =-n= can now also be added
    to include file statements:

: #+INCLUDE "~/.emacs" src emacs-lisp -n -r

    Thanks to Manish for pointing out that this was not yet
    supported.

*** Examples can be exported to HTML as text areas
    
    You can now specify a =-t= switch to an example or src block,
    to make it export to HTML as a text area.  To change the
    defaults for height (number of lines in the example) and
    width of this area (80), use the =-h= and =-w= switches.

    Thanks to Ulf Stegemann for driving this development.

*** LaTeX_CLASS can be given as a property

    When exporting a single subtree by selecting it as a region
    before export, the LaTeX class for the export will be taken
    from the =LaTeX_CLASS= property of the entry if present.

    Thanks to Robert Goldman for this request.

*** Better handling of inlined images in different backends

    Two new variables govern which kind of files can be inlined
    during export.  These are
    =org-export-html-inline-image-extensions= and
    =org-export-latex-inline-image-extensions=.  Remember that
    links are turned into an inline image if they are a pure link
    with no description.  HTML files can inline /.png/, /.jpg/,
    and /.gif/ files, while LaTeX files, when processed with
    /pdflatex/, can inline /.png/, /.jpg/, and /.pdf/ files.
    These also represent the default settings for the new
    variables.  Note that this means that pure links to /.pdf/
    files will be inlined - to avoid this for a particular link,
    make sure that the link has a description part which is not
    equal to the link part.

*** Links by ID now continue to work in HTML exported files

    If you make links by ID, these links will now still work in
    HTML exported files, provided that you keep the relative path
    from link to target file the same.

    Thanks to Friedrich Delgado Friedrichs for pushing this over
    the line.

*** The relative timer can be paused

    The new command `C-c C-x ,' will pause the relative timer.
    When the relative timer is running, its value will be shown
    in the mode line.  To get rid of this display, you need to
    really stop the timer with `C-u C-c C-x ,'.

    Thanks to Alan Davis for driving this change.

*** The attachment directory may now be chosen by the user

    Instead of using the automatic, unique directory related to
    the entry ID, you can also use a chosen directory for the
    attachments of an entry.  This directory is specified by the
    ATTACH_DIR property.  You can use `C-c C-a s' to set this
    property.

    Thanks to Jason Jackson for this proposal.

*** You can use a single attachment directory for a subtree

    By setting the property ATTACH_DIR_INHERIT, you can now tell
    Org that children of the entry should use the same directory
    for attachments, unless a child explicitly defines its own
    directory with the ATTACH_DIR property.  You can use the
    command `C-c C-a i' to set this property in an entry.

* Version 6.17

** Overview

- Footnote support
- Line numbers and references in literal examples 
- New hooks for export preprocessing 
- Capture column view into a different file

** Details

*** Footnote support

Org-mode now directly supports the creation of footnotes.  In
contrast to the /footnote.el/ package, Org-mode's footnotes are
designed for work on a larger document, not only for one-off
documents like emails.  The basic syntax is similar to the one
used by /footnote.el/, i.e. a footnote is defined in a paragraph
that is started by a footnote marker in square brackets in column
0, no indentation allowed.  The footnote reference is simply the
marker in square brackets inside text.  For example:

#+begin_src org
The Org homepage[fn:1] now looks a lot better than it used to.
...
[fn:1] The link is: http://orgmode.org
#+end_src

Org-mode extends the number-based syntax to /named/ footnotes and
optional inline definition.  Using plain numbers as markers is
supported for backward compatibility, but not encouraged because
of possible conflicts with LaTeX syntax.  Here are the valid
references:

- [1] ::  A plain numeric footnote marker.
	 
- [fn:name] :: A named footnote reference, where `name' is a
     unique label word or, for simplicity of automatic creation,
     a number. 
     
- [fn:: This is the inline definition of this footnote] :: A
     LaTeX-like anonymous footnote where the definition is given
     directly at the reference point.

- [fn:name: a definition] :: An inline definition of a footnote,
     which also specifies a name for the note.  Since Org allows
     multiple references to the same note, you can then use use
     `[fn:name]' to create additional references.

Footnote labels can be created automatically, or you create names
yourself.  This is handled by the variable
=org-footnote-auto-label= and its corresponding =#+STARTUP=
keywords, see the docstring of that variable for details.

The following command handles footnotes:

- C-c C-x f :: The footnote action command.  When the cursor is
     on a footnote reference, jump to the definition.  When it is
     at a definition, jump to the (first) reference.  Otherwise,
     create a new footnote.  Depending on the variable
     `org-footnote-define-inline' (with associated =#+STARTUP=
     options =fninline= and =nofninline=), the definitions will
     be placed right into the text as part of the reference, or
     separately into the location determined by the variable
     =org-footnote-section=.
     When this command is called with a prefix argument, a menu
     of additional options is offered:
     - s :: Sort the footnote definitions by reference sequence.
            During editing, Org makes no effort to sort footnote
            definitions into a particular sequence.  If you want
            them sorted, use this command, which will also move
            entries according to =org-footnote-section=.
     - n :: Normalize the footnotes by collecting all
            definitions (including inline definitions) into a
            special section, and then numbering them in
            sequence.  The references will then also be
            numbers.  This is meant to be the final step before
            finishing a document (e.g. sending off an email).
            The exporters do this automatically, and so could 
            something like `message-send-hook'.
     - d :: Delete the footnote at point, and all references to it.
	    
- C-c C-c :: If the cursor is on a footnote reference, jump to
     the definition.  If it is a the definition, jump back to the
     reference.  When called with a prefix argument at either
     location, offer the same menu as `C-u C-c C-x f'.

- C-c C-o or mouse-1/2 :: Footnote labels are also links to the
     corresponding definition/reference, and you can use the
     usual commands to follow these links.

Org-mode's footnote support is designed so that it should also
work in buffers that are not in Org-mode, for example in email
messages.  Just bind =org-footnote-action= to a global key like
=C-c f=.

The main trigger for this development came from a hook function
written by Paul Rivier, to implement named footnotes and to
convert them to numbered ones before export.  Thanks, Paul!

Thanks also to Scot Becker for a thoughtful post bringing this
subject back onto the discussion table, and to Matt Lundin for
the idea of named footnotes and his prompt testing of the new
features.

*** Line numbers and references in literal examples

Literal examples introduced with =#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE= or =#+BEGIN_SRC=
do now allow optional line numbering in the example.
Furthermore, links to specific code lines are supported, greatly
increasing Org-mode's utility for writing tutorials and other
similar documents.

Code references use special labels embedded directly into the
source code.  Such labels look like "(ref:name)" and must be
unique within a document.  Org-mode links with "(name)" in the
link part will be correctly interpreted, both while working with
an Org file (internal links), and while exporting to the
different backends.  Line numbering and code references are
supported for all three major backends, HTML, LaTeX, and ASCII.
In the HTML backend, hovering the mouse over a link to a source
line will remote-highlight the referenced code line.

The options for the BEGIN lines are:

 - -n :: Number the lines in the example
 - +n :: Like -n, but continue numbering from where the previous
         example left off.
 - -r :: Remove the coderef cookies from the example, and replace
         links to this reference with line numbers.  This option
         takes only effect if either -n or +n are given as well.
         If -r is not given, coderefs simply use the label name.
 - -l "fmt" :: Define a local format for coderef labels, see the
      variable =org-coderef-label-format= for details.  Use this
      of the default syntax causes conflicts with the code in the
      code snippet you are using.

Here is an example:

#+begin_example -k
#+begin_src emacs-lisp -n -r
(defmacro org-unmodified (&rest body)                   (ref:def)
  "Execute body without changing `buffer-modified-p'."
  `(set-buffer-modified-p                              (ref:back)
    (prog1 (buffer-modified-p) ,@body)))
#+end_src
[[(def)][Line (def)]] contains the macro name.  Later at line [[(back)]],
backquoting is used.
#+end_example

When exported, this is translated to:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp -n -r
(defmacro org-unmodified (&rest body)                   (ref:def)
  "Execute body without changing `buffer-modified-p'."
  `(set-buffer-modified-p                              (ref:back)
    (prog1 (buffer-modified-p) ,@body)))
#+end_src
[[(def)][Line (def)]] contains the macro name.  Later at line [[(back)]],
backquoting is used.

Thanks to Ilya Shlyakhter for proposing this feature set.  Thanks
to Sebastian Rose for the key Javascript element that made the
remote highlighting possible.

*** New hooks for export preprocessing
    The export preprocessor now runs more hooks, to allow
    better-timed tweaking by user functions:

- =org-export-preprocess-hook= ::
  Pretty much the first thing in the preprocessor.  But org-mode
  is already active in the preprocessing buffer.

- =org-export-preprocess-after-include-files-hook= ::
  This is run after the contents of included files have been inserted.

- =org-export-preprocess-after-tree-selection-hook= ::
  This is run after selection of trees to be exported has
  happened.  This selection includes tags-based selection, as
  well as removal of commented and archived trees.

- =org-export-preprocess-before-backend-specifics-hook= ::
  Hook run before backend-specific functions are called during preprocessing.

- =org-export-preprocess-final-hook= ::
  Hook for preprocessing an export buffer.  This is run as the
  last thing in the preprocessing buffer, just before returning
  the buffer string to the backend.

*** Capture column view into a different file

    The :id parameter for the dynamic block capturing column view
    can now truly be an ID that will also be found in a
    different file.  Also, it can be like =file:path/to/file=, to
    capture the global column view from a different file.

    Thanks to Francois Lagarde for his report that IDs outside
    the current file would not work.

* Version 6.16
  Cleanup of many small bugs, and one new feature.

** Details

*** References to last table row with special names

    Fields in the last row of a table can now be referenced with
    $LR1, $LR2, etc.  These references can appear both on the
    left hand side and right hand side of a formula.

* Version 6.15f

  This version reverses the introduction of @0 as a reference to
  the last rwo in a table, because of a conflict with the use of
  @0 for the current row.

* Version 6.15
** Overview

- All known LaTeX export issues fixed 
- Captions and attributes for figures and tables. 
- Better implementation for entry IDs 
- Spreadsheet references to the last table line. 
- Old syntax for link attributes abandoned 

** Incompatible changes
*** Old syntax for link attributes abandoned

There used to be a syntax for setting link attributes for
HTML export by enclosing the attributes into double braces
and adding them to the link itself, like

#+begin_example
[[./img/a.jpg{{alt="an image"}}] ]
#+end_example

This syntax is not longer supported, use instead

#+begin_src org
,#+ATTR_HTML: alt="an image"
[[./img/a.jpg] ]
#+end_src

** Details

*** All known LaTeX export issues fixed

All the remaining issues with the LaTeX exporter have hopefully
been addressed in this release.  In particular, this covers
quoting of special characters in tables and problems with
exporting files where the headline is in the first line, or with
an active region.

*** Captions and attributes for figures and tables.

Tables, and Hyperlinks that represent inlined images, can now be
equipped with additional information that will be used during
export.  The information will be taken from the following special
lines in the buffer and apply to the first following table or
link.

- #+CAPTION: :: The caption of the image or table.  This string
     should be processed according to the export backend, but
     this is not yet done.

- #+LABEL: :: A label to identify the figure/table for cross
     references.  For HTML export, this string will become the
     ID for the ~<div class="figure">~ element that encapsulates
     the image tag and the caption.  For LaTeX export, this
     string will be used as the argument of a ~\label{...}~
     macro.  These labels will be available for internal links
     like ~[[label][Table] ]~.

- #+ATTR_HTML: :: Attributes for HTML export of image, to be
     added as attributes into the ~<img...>~ tag.  This string
     will not be processed, so it should have immediately the
     right format.

- #+ATTR_LaTeX: :: Attributes for LaTeX export of images and
     tables.\\
     For /images/, this string is directly inserted into
     the optional argument of the ~\includegraphics[...]{file}~
     command, to specify scaling, clipping and other options.
     This string will not be processed, so it should have
     immediately the right format, like =width=5cm,angle=90=.\\       
     For /tables/, this can currently contain the keyword
     =longtable=, to request typesetting of the table using the
     longtable package, which automatically distributes the table
     over several pages if needed.  Also, the attributes line may
     contain an alignment string for the tabular environment, like
     =longtable,align=l|lrl=

For LaTeX export, if either a caption or a label is given, the element
will be exported as a float, i.e. wrapped into a figure or table
environment.

*** Better implementation for entry IDs
    
Unique identifiers for entries can now be used more efficiently.
Internally, a hash array has replaced the alist used so far to
keep track of the files in which an ID is defined.  This makes it
quite fast to find an entry by ID.

There is a new link type which looks like this:

#+begin_example
id:GLOBALLY-UNIQUE-IDENTIFIER
#+end_example

This link points to a specific entry.  When you move the entry to
a different file, for example if you move it to an archive
file, the link will continue to work.

The file /org-id.el/ contains an API that can be used to write
code using these identifiers, including creating IDs and finding
them wherever they are.

Org has its own method to create unique identifiers, but if the system
has /uuidgen/ command installed (Mac's and Linux systems generally
do), it will be used by default (a change compared to the earlier
implmentation, where you explicitdly had to opt for uuidgen).  You can
also select the method by hand, using the variable =org-id-method=.

If the ID system ever gets confused about where a certain ID is, it
initiates a global scan of all agenda files with associated archives,
all files previously known containing any IDs, and all currently
visited Org-mode files to rebuild the hash.  You can also initiate
this by hand: =M-x org-id-update-id-locations=.  Running this command
will also dump into the =*Messages*= buffer information about any
duplicate IDs.  These should not exist, and Org will never /make/ the
same ID twice, but if you /copy/ an entry with its properties,
duplicate IDs will inevitably be produced.  Unfortunately, this is
unavoidable in a plain text system that allows you to edit the text in
arbitrary ways, and a portion of care on your side is needed to keep
this system clean.

The hash is stored in the file =~/.emacs.d/.org-id-locations=.
This is also a change from previous versions where the file was
=~/.org=id-locations=.  Therefore, you can remove this old file
if you have it.  I am not sure what will happen if the =.emacs.d=
directory does not exists in your setup, but in modern Emacsen, I
believe it should exist.  If you do not want to use IDs across
files, you can avoid the overhead with tracking IDs by
customizing the variable =org-id-track-globally=.  IDs can then
still be used for links inside a single file.

IDs will also be used when you create a new link to an Org-mode
buffer.  If you use =org-store-link= (normally at =C-c l=) inside
en entry in an Org-mode buffer, and ID property will be created
if it does not exist, and the stored link will be an =id:= link.
If you prefer the much less secure linking to headline text, you
can configure the variable =org-link-to-org-use-id=.  The default
setting for this variable is =create-if-interactive=, meaning
that an ID will be created when you store a link interactively,
but not if you happen to be in an Org-mode file while you create
a remember note (which usually has a link to the place where you
were when starting remember).

*** Spreadsheet references to the last table line.

You may now use =@0= to reference the last dataline in a table
in a stable way.  This is useful in particular for automatically
generated tables like the ones using /org-collector.el/ by Eric
Schulte.

*** Relative row references crossing hlines now throw an error
    
    Relative row references in tables look like this: "@-4" which
    means the forth row above this one.  These row references are
    not allowed to cross horizontal separator lines (hlines).  So
    far, when a row reference violates this policy, Org would
    silently choose the field just next to the hline.

    Tassilo Horn pointed out that this kind of hidden magic is
    actually confusing and may cause incorrect formulas, and I do
    agree.  Therefore, trying to cross a hline with a relative
    reference will now throw an error.
    
    If you need the old behavior, customize the variable
    `org-table-error-on-row-ref-crossing-hline'.

*** New relative timer to support timed notes

    Org now supports taking timed notes, useful for example while
    watching a video, or during a meeting which is also recorded.

    - =C-c C-x .= :: 
      Insert a relative time into the buffer.  The first time
      you use this, the timer will be started.  When called
      with a prefix argument, the timer is reset to 0.

    - =C-c C-x -= :: 
      Insert a description list item with the current relative
      time.  With a prefix argument, first reset the timer to 0.

    - =M-RET= ::
      Once the time list has been initiated, you can also use the
      normal item-creating command to insert the next timer item.

    - =C-c C-x 0= :: 
      Reset the timer without inserting anything into the buffer.
      By default, the timer is reset to 0.  When called with a
      =C-u= prefix, reset the timer to specific starting
      offset.  The user is prompted for the offset, with a
      default taken from a timer string at point, if any, So this
      can be used to restart taking notes after a break in the
      process.  When called with a double prefix argument
      =C-c C-u=, change all timer strings in the active
      region by a certain amount.  This can be used to fix timer
      strings if the timer was not started at exactly the right
      moment.

    Thanks to Alan Dove, Adam Spiers, and Alan Davis for
    contributions to this idea.

*** Special faces can be set for individual tags

    You may now use the variable =org-tag-faces= to define the
    face used for specific tags, much in the same way as you can
    do for TODO keywords.

    Thanks to Samuel Wales for this proposal.

*** The agenda shows now all tags, including inherited ones.

    This request has come up often, most recently it was
    formulated by Tassilo Horn.

    If you prefer the old behavior of only showing the local
    tags, customize the variable =org-agenda-show-inherited-tags=.

*** Exclude some tags from inheritance.

    So far, the only way to select tags for inheritance was to
    allow it for all tags, or to do a positive selection using
    one of the more complex settings for
    `org-use-tag-inheritance'.  It may actually be better to
    allow inheritance for all but a few tags, which was difficult
    to achieve with this methodology.

    A new option, `org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance', allows to
    specify an exclusion list for inherited tags.

*** More special values for time comparisons in property searches

    In addition to =<now>=, =<today>=, =<yesterday>=, and
    =<tomorrow>=, there are more special values accepted now in
    time comparisons in property searches:  You may use strings
    like =<+3d>= or =<-2w>=, with units d, w, m, and y for day,
    week, month, and year, respectively

    Thanks to Linday Todd for this proposal.

*** Control for exporting meta data

    All the metadata in a headline, i.e. the TODO keyword, the
    priority cookie, and the tags, can now be excluded from
    export with appropriate options:

    | Variable                      | Publishing property | OPTIONS switch |
    |-------------------------------+---------------------+----------------|
    | org-export-with-todo-keywords | :todo-keywords      | todo:          |
    | org-export-with-tags          | :tags               | tags:          |
    | org-export-with-priority      | :priority           | pri:           |

*** Cut and Paste with hot links from w3m to Org

    You can now use the key =C-c C-x M-w= in a w3m buffer with
    HTML content to copy either the region or the entire file in
    a special way.  When you yank this text back into an Org-mode
    buffer, all links from the w3m buffer will continue to work
    under Org-mode.

    For this to work you need to load the new file /org-w3m.el./
    Please check your org-modules variable to make sure that this
    is turned on.

    Thanks for Richard Riley for the idea and to Andy Stewart for
    the implementation.

*** LOCATION can be inherited for iCalendar export

    The LOCATION property can now be inherited during iCalendar
    export if you configure =org-use-property-inheritance= like
    this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-use-property-inheritance '("LOCATION"))
#+end_src

* Version 6.13

*** Keybindings in Remember buffers can be configured

    The remember buffers created with Org's extensions are in
    Org-mode, which is nice to prepare snippets that will
    actually be stored in Org-mode files.  However, this makes it
    hard to configure key bindings without modifying the Org-mode
    keymap.  There is now a minor mode active in these buffers,
    `org-remember-mode', and its keymap org-remember-mode-map can
    be used for key bindings.  By default, this map only contains
    the bindings for =C-c C-c= to store the note, and =C-c C-k=
    to abort it.  Use `org-remember-mode-hook' to define your own
    bindings like

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook
 'org-remember-mode-hook
 (lambda ()
   (define-key org-remember-mode-map
     "\C-x\C-s" 'org-remember-finalize)))
#+end_src

    If you wish, you can also use this to free the =C-c C-c=
    binding (by binding this key to nil in the minor mode map),
    so that you can use =C-c C-c= again to set tags.

    This modification is based on a request by Tim O'Callaghan.

*** Support for ido completion

    You can now get the completion interface from /ido.el/ for
    many of Org's internal completion commands by turning on the
    variable =org-completion-use-ido=. =ido-mode= must also be
    active before you can use this.

    This change is based upon a request by Samuel Wales.

*** New face for date lines in agenda column view

    When column view is active in the agenda, and when you have
    summarizing properties, the date lines become normal column
    lines and the separation between different days becomes
    harder to see.  If this bothers you, you can now customize
    the face =org-agenda-column-dateline=.

    This is based on a request by George Pearson.

*** Invisible targets become now anchors in headlines.

    These anchors can be used to jump to a directly with an HTML
    link, just like the =sec-xxx= IDs.  For example, the
    following will make a http link
    =//domain/path-to-my-file.html#dummy= work:

#+begin_src org
,# <<dummy>>
,*** a headline
#+end_src

    This is based on a request by Matt Lundin.

*** New contributed file /org-exp-blocks.el/

    This new file implements special export behavior of
    user-defined blocks.  The currently supported blocks are

    - comment :: Comment blocks with author-specific markup
    - ditaa ::  conversion of ASCII art into pretty png files
	 using Stathis  Sideris' /ditaa.jar/ program
    - dot :: creation of graphs in the /dot/ language
    - R :: Sweave type exporting using the R program

    For more details and examples, see the file commentary in
    /org-exp-blocks.el/.

    Kudos to Eric Schulte for this new functionality, after
    /org-plot.el/ already his second major contribution.  Thanks
    to Stathis for this excellent program, and for allowing us to
    bundle it with Org-mode.

*** New contributed file /org-eval-light.el/

    This module gives control over execution Emacs Lisp code
    blocks included in a file.

    Thanks to Eric Schulte also for this file.

*** Link translation

    You can now configure Org to understand many links created
    with the Emacs Planner package, so you can cut text from
    planner pages and paste them into Org-mode files without
    having to re-write the links.  Among other things, this means
    that the command =org-open-at-point-global= which follows
    links not only in Org-mode, but in arbitrary files like
    source code files etc, will work also with links created by
    planner. The following customization is needed to make all of
    this work

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-link-translation-function
      'org-translate-link-from-planner)
#+end_src

   I guess an inverse translator could be written and integrated
   into Planner.

*** BBDB links may use regular expressions.

    This did work all along, but only now I have documented it.

*** =yank-pop= works again after yanking an outline tree

    Samuel Wales had noticed that =org-yank= did mess up this
    functionality.  Now you can use =yank-pop= again, the only
    restriction is that the so-yanked text will not be
    pro/demoted or folded.

*** Link abbreviations can use %h to insert a url-encoded target value

    Thanks to Steve Purcell for a patch to this effect.

*** Improved XHTML compliance

    Thanks to Sebastian Rose for pushing this.

*** Many bug fixes again.
    
* Version 6.12
** Overview

   - A region of entries can now be refiled with a single command
   - Fine-tuning the behavior of `org-yank'
   - Formulas for clocktables
   - Better implementation of footnotes for HTML export
   - More languages for HTML export.

** Details

*** A region of entries can now be refiled with a single command
    
    With =transient-make-mode= active (=zmacs-regions= under
    XEmacs), you can now select a region of entries and refile
    them all with a single =C-c C-w= command.

    Thanks to Samuel Wales for this useful proposal.

*** Fine-tuning the behavior of =org-yank=

    The behavior of Org's yanking command has been further
    fine-tuned in order to avoid some of the small annoyances
    this command caused.

    - Calling =org-yank= with a prefix arg will stop any special
      treatment and directly pass through to the normal =yank=
      command.  Therefore, you can now force a normal yank with
      =C-u C-y=.

    - Subtrees will only be folded after a yank if doing so will
      now swallow any non-white characters after the yanked text.
      This is, I think a really important change to make the
      command work more sanely.

*** Formulas for clocktables

    You can now add formulas to a clock table, either by hand, or
    with a =:formula= parameter.  These formulas can be used to
    create additional columns with further analysis of the
    measured times.

    Thanks to Jurgen Defurne for triggering this addition.

*** Better implementation of footnotes for HTML export
    
    The footnote export in 6.11 really was not good enough.  Now
    it works fine.  If you have customized
    =footnote-section-tag=, make sure that your customization is
    matched by =footnote-section-tag-regexp=.

    Thanks to Sebastian Rose for pushing this change.

*** More languages for HTML export.

    More languages are supported during HTML export.  This is
    only relevant for the few special words Org inserts, like
    "Table of Contents", or "Footnotes".  Also the encoding
    issues with this feature seem to be solved now.

    Thanks to Sebastian Rose for pushing me to fix the encoding
    problems.

* Version 6.11

** Overview

   - Yanking subtree with =C-y= now adjusts the tree level
   - State changes can now be shown in the log mode in the agenda
   - Footnote in HTML export are now collected at the end of the document
   - HTML export now validates again as XHTML
   - The clock can now be resumed after exiting and re-starting Emacs
   - Clock-related data can be saved and resumed across Emacs sessions
   - Following file links can now use C-u C-u to force use of an external app
   - Inserting absolute files names now abbreviates links with "~"
   - Links to attachment files
   - Completed repeated tasks listed briefly in agenda
   - Remove buffers created during publishing are removed

** Details

*** Yanking subtree with =C-y= now adjusts the tree level
    When yanking a cut/copied subtree or a series of trees, the
    normal yank key =C-y= now adjusts the level of the tree to
    make it fit into the current outline position, without losing
    its identity, and without swallowing other subtrees.

    This uses the command =org-past-subtree=.  An additional
    change in that command has been implemented: Normally, this
    command picks the right outline level from the surrounding
    *visible* headlines, and uses the smaller one.  So if the
    cursor is between a level 4 and a level 3 headline, the tree
    will be pasted as level 3.  If the cursor is actually *at*
    the beginning of a headline, the level of that headline will
    be used.  For example, lets say you have a tree like this:

#+begin_src org
,* Level one
,** Level two
,(1)
,(2)* Level one again
#+end_src

    with (1) and (2) indicating possible cursor positions for the
    insertion.  When at (1), the tree will be pasted as level 2.
    When at (2), it will be pasted as level 1.

    If you do not want =C-y= to behave like this, configure the
    variable =org-yank-adjusted-subtrees=.

    Thanks to Samuel Wales for this idea and a partial implementation.

*** State changes can now be shown in the log mode in the agenda

    If you configure the variable =org-agenda-log-mode-items=,
    you can now request that all logged state changes be included
    in the agenda when log mode is active.  If you find this too
    much for normal applications, you can also temporarily
    request the inclusion of state changes by pressing =C-u l= in
    the agenda.

    This was a request by Hsiu-Khuern Tang.

    You can also press `C-u C-u l' to get *only* log items in the
    agenda, withour any timestamps/deadlines etc.

*** Footnote in HTML export are now collected at the end of the document
    Previously, footnotes would be left in the document where
    they are defined, now they are all collected and put into a
    special =<div>= at the end of the document.

    Thanks to Sebastian Rose for this request.

*** HTML export now validates again as XHTML.

    Thanks to Sebastian Rose for pushing this cleanup.

*** The clock can now be resumed after exiting and re-starting Emacs

    If the option =org-clock-in-resume= is t, and the first clock
    line in an entry is unclosed, clocking into that task resumes
    the clock from that time.

    Thanks to James TD Smith for a patch to this effect.

*** Clock-related data can be saved and resumed across Emacs sessions
    
    The data saved include the contents of =org-clock-history=,
    and the running clock, if there is one.
    
    To use this, you will need to add to your .emacs

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-clock-persist t)
(setq org-clock-in-resume t)
(org-clock-persistence-insinuate)
#+end_src

    Thanks to James TD Smith for a patch to this effect.

*** Following file links can now use C-u C-u to force use of an external app.

    So far you could only bypass your setup in `org-file-apps'
    and force opening a file link in Emacs by using a =C-u= prefix arg
    with =C-c C-o=.  Now you can call =C-u C-u C-c C-o= to force
    an external application.  Which external application depends
    on your system.  On Mac OS X and Windows, =open= is used.  On
    a GNU/Linux system, the mailcap settings are used.

    This was a proposal by Samuel Wales.

*** Inserting absolute files names now abbreviates links with "~".

    Inserting file links with =C-u C-c C-l= was buggy if the
    setting of `org-link-file-path-type' was `adaptive' (the
    default).  Absolute file paths were not abbreviated relative
    to the users home directory.  This bug has been fixed.

    Thanks to Matt Lundin for the report.

*** Links to attachment files

    Even though one of the purposes of entry attachments was to
    reduce the number of links in an entry, one might still want
    to have the occasional link to one of those files.  You can
    now use link abbreviations to set up a special link type that
    points to attachments in the current entry.  Note that such
    links will only work from within the same entry that has the
    attachment, because the directory path is entry specific.
    Here is the setup you need:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-link-abbrev-alist '(("att" . org-attach-expand-link)))
#+end_src

    After this, a link like this will work

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     [[att:some-attached-file.txt]]
#+END_EXAMPLE
    This was a proposal by Lindsay Todd.

*** Completed repeated tasks listed briefly in agenda

    When a repeating task, listed in the daily/weekly agenda under
    today's date, is completed from the agenda, it is listed as
    DONE in the agenda until the next update happens.  After the
    next update, the task will have disappeared, of course,
    because the new date is no longer today.
    
*** Remove buffers created during publishing are removed

    Buffers that are created during publishing are now deleted
    when the publishing is over.  At least I hope it works like this.

* Version 6.10

** Overview

   - Secondary agenda filtering is becoming a killer feature
   - Setting tags has now its own binding, =C-c C-q=
   - Todo state changes can trigger tag changes
   - C-RET will now always insert a new headline, never an item.
   - Customize org-mouse.el feature set to free up mouse events
   - New commands for export all the way to PDF (through LaTeX)
   - Some bug fixed for LaTeX export, more bugs remain.

** Details

*** Enhancements to secondary agenda filtering

    This is, I believe, becoming a killer feature.  It allows you
    to define fewer and more general custom agenda commands, and
    then to do the final narrowing to specific tasks you are
    looking for very quickly, much faster than calling a new
    agenda command.

    If you have not tries this yet, you should!

**** You can now refining the current filter by an additional criterion
      When filtering an existing agenda view with =/=, you can
      now narrow down the existing selection by an additional
      condition.  Do do this, use =\= instead of =/= to add the
      additional criterion.  You can also press =+= or =-= after
      =/= to add a positive or negative condition.  A condition
      can be a TAG, or an effort estimate limit, see below.

**** It is now possible to filter for effort estimates
     This means to filter the agenda for the value of the Effort
     property.  For this you should best set up global allowed
     values for effort estimates, with

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-global-properties
      '(("Effort_ALL" . "0 0:10 0:30 1:00 2:00 3:00 4:00")))
#+end_src
      
     You may then select effort limits with single keys in the
     filter.  It works like this:  After =/= or =\=, first select
     the operator which you want to use to compare effort
     estimates:

     : <   Select entries with effort smaller than or equal to the limit
     : >   Select entries with effort larger than or equal to the limit
     : =   Select entries with effort equal to the limit

     After that, you can press a single digit number which is
     used as an index to the allowed effort estimates.

     If you do not use digits to fast-select tags, you can even
     skip the operator, which will then default to
     `org-agenda-filter-effort-default-operator', which is by
     default =<=.

     Thanks to Manish for the great idea to include fast effort
     filtering into the agenda filtering process.

**** The mode line will show the active filter
     For example, if there is a filter in place that does select
     for HOME tags, against EMAIL tags, and for tasks with an
     estimated effort smaller than 30 minutes, the mode-line with
     show =+HOME-EMAIL+<0:30=

**** The filter now persists when the agenda view is refreshed
     All normal refresh commands, including those that move the
     weekly agenda from one week to the next, now keep the
     current filter in place.

     You need to press =/ /= to turn off the filter.  However,
     when you run a new agenda command, for example going from
     the weekly agenda to the TODO list, the filter will be
     switched off.
   
*** Setting tags has now its own binding, =C-c C-q=

    You can still use =C-c C-c= on a headline, but the new
    binding should be considered as the main binding for this
    command.  The reasons for this change are:

    - Using =C-c C-c= for tags is really out of line with other
      uses of =C-c C-c=.

    - I hate it in Remember buffers when I try to set tags and I
      cannot, because =C-c C-c= exits the buffer :-(

    - =C-c C-q= will also work when the cursor is somewhere down
      in the entry, it does not have to be on the headline.

*** Todo state changes can trigger tag changes

    The new option =org-todo-state-tags-triggers= can be used to
    define automatic changes to tags when a TODO state changes.
    For example, the setting

    : (setq org-todo-state-tags-triggers
    :       '((done ("Today" . nil) ("NEXT" . nil))
    :         ("WAITING" ("Today" . t))))    

    will make sure that any change to any of the DONE states will
    remove tags "Today" and "NEXT", while switching to the
    "WAITING" state will trigger the tag "Today" to be added.

    I use this mostly to get rid of TODAY and NEXT tags which I
    apply to select an entry for execution in the near future,
    which I often prefer to specific time scheduling.

*** C-RET will now always insert a new headline, never an item.
    The new headline is inserted after the current subtree.

    Thanks to Peter Jones for patches to fine-tune this behavior.

*** Customize org-mouse.el feature set
    There is a new variable =org-mouse-features= which gives you
    some control about what features of org-mouse you want to
    use.  Turning off some of the feature will free up the
    corresponding mouse events, or will avoid activating special
    regions for mouse clicks.  By default I have urned off the
    feature to use drag mouse events to move or promote/demote
    entries.  You can of course turn them back on if you wish.

    This variable may still change in the future, allowing more
    fine-grained control.

*** New commands for export to PDF

    This is using LaTeX export, and then processes it to PDF
    using pdflatex.

    : C-c C-e p     process to PDF.
    : C-c C-e d     process to PDF, and open the file.

*** LaTeX export
    - \usepackage{graphicx} is now part of the standard class
      definitions.
    - Several bugs fixed, but definitely not all of them :-(

*** New option `org-log-state-notes-insert-after-drawers'

    Set this to =t= if you want state change notes to be inserted
    after any initial drawers, i.e drawers the immediately follow
    the headline and the planning line (the one with
    DEADLINE/SCHEDULED/CLOSED information).

* Version 6.09
** Incompatible
*** =org-file-apps= now uses regular expressions, see [[*%20org%20file%20apps%20now%20uses%20regular%20repressions%20instead%20of%20extensions][below]]

** Details

*** =org-file-apps= now uses regular repressions instead of extensions
    Just like in =auto-mode-alist=, car's in the variable
    =org-file-apps= that are strings are now interpreted as
    regular expressions that are matched against a file name.  So
    instead of "txt", you should now write "\\.txt\\'" to make
    sure the matching is done correctly (even though "txt" will
    be recognized and still be interpreted as an extension).

    There is now a shortcut to get many file types visited by
    Emacs.  If org-file-apps contains `(auto-mode . emacs)', then
    any files that are matched by `auto-mode-alist' will be
    visited in emacs.

*** Changes to the attachment system

    - The default method to attach a file is now to copy it
      instead of moving it.
    - You can modify the default method using the variable
      `org-attach-method'.  I believe that most Unix people want
      to set it to `ln' to create hard links.
    - The keys =c=, =m=, and =l= specifically select =copy=,
      =move=, or =link=, respectively, as the attachment method
      for a file, overruling  `org-attach-method'.
    - To create a new attachment as an Emacs buffer, you have not
      now use =n= instead of =c=.
    - The file list is now always retrieved from the directory
      itself, not from the "Attachments" property.  We still
      keep this property by default, but you can turn it off, by
      customizing the variable =org-attach-file-list-property=.

* Version 6.08

** Incompatible changes

   - Changes in the structure of IDs, see [[*The%20default%20structure%20of%20IDs%20has%20changed][here]] for details.

   - C-c C-a has been redefined, see [[*%20C%20c%20C%20a%20no%20longer%20calls%20show%20all][here]] for details.

*** The default structure of IDs has changed

    IDs created by Org have changed a bit:
    - By default, there is no prefix on the ID.  There used to be
      an "Org" prefix, but I now think this is not necessary.
    - IDs use only lower-case letters, no upper-case letters
      anymore.  The reason for this is that IDs are now also used
      as directory names for org-attach, and some systems do not
      distinguish upper and lower case in the file system.
    - The ID string derived from the current time is now
      /reversed/ to become an ID.  This assures that the first
      two letters of the ID change fast, so hat it makes sense to
      split them off to create subdirectories to balance load.
    - You can now set the `org-id-method' to `uuidgen' on systems
      which support it.

*** =C-c C-a= no longer calls `show-all'

    The reason for this is that =C-c C-a= is now used for the
    attachment system.  On the rare occasions that this command
    is needed, use =M-x show-all=, or =C-u C-u C-u TAB=.

*** New attachment system

    You can now attach files to each node in the outline tree.
    This works by creating special directories based on the ID of
    an entry, and storing files in these directories.  Org can
    keep track of changes to the attachments by automatically
    committing changes to git.  See the manual for more
    information.

    Thanks to John Wiegley who contributed this fantastic new
    concept and wrote org-attach.el to implement it.

*** New remember template escapes

    : %^{prop}p   to insert a property
    : %k          the heading of the item currently being clocked
    : %K          a link to the heading of the item currently being clocked

    Also, when you exit remember with =C-2 C-c C-c=, the item
    will be filed as a child of the item currently being
    clocked.  So the idea is, if you are working on something and
    think of a new task related to this or a new note to be
    added, you can use this to quickly add information to that
    task.

    Thanks to James TD Smith for a patch to this effect.

*** Clicking with mouse-2 on clock info in mode-line visits the clock.
    
    Thanks to James TD Smith for a patch to this effect.

*** New file in contrib: lisp/org-checklist.el

    This module deals with repeated tasks that have checkbox
    lists below them.

    Thanks to James TD Smith for this contribution.

*** New in-buffer setting #+STYLE

    It can be used to locally set the variable
    `org-export-html-style-extra'.  Several such lines are
    allowed-, they will all be concatenated.  For an example on
    how to use it, see the [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.php][publishing tutorial]].

** Incompatible changes

*** Prefix interpretation when storing remember notes has changed

    The prefix argument to the `C-c C-c' command that finishes a
    remember process is now interpreted differently:

    : C-c C-c       Store the note to predefined file and headline
    : C-u C-c C-c   Like C-c C-c, but immediately visit the note
    :               in its new location.
    : C-1 C-c C-c   Select the storage location interactively
    : C-0 C-c C-c   Re-use the last used location

    This was requested by John Wiegley.

*** Capturing column view is now on `C-c C-x i'

    The reason for this change was that `C-c C-x r' is also used
    as a tty key replacement.

*** Categories in iCalendar export now include local tags

    The locally defined tags are now listed as categories when
    exporting to iCalendar format.  Org's traditional file/tree
    category is now the last category in this list.  Configure
    the variable =org-icalendar-categories= to modify or revert
    this behavior.

    This was a request by Charles Philip Chan.

** Details

*** Secondary filtering of agenda views.

    You can now easily and interactively filter an existing
    agenda view with respect to a tag.  This command is executed
    with the =/= key in the agenda.  You will be prompted for a
    tag selection key, and all entries that do not contain or
    inherit the corresponding tag will be hidden.  With a prefix
    argument, the opposite filter is applied: entries that
    do have the tag will be hidden.

    This operation only /hides/ lines in the agenda buffer, it
    does not remove them.  Changing the secondary filtering does
    not require a new search and is very fast.

    If you press TAB at the tag selection prompt, you will be
    switched to a completion interface to select a tag.  This is
    useful when you want to select a tag that does not have a
    direct access character.

    A double =/ /= will restore the original agenda view by
    unhiding any hidden lines.

    This functionality was John Wiegley's idea.  It is a simpler
    implementation of some of the query-editing features proposed
    and implemented some time ago by Christopher League (see the
    file contrib/lisp/org-interactive-query.el).

*** Editing fixed-width regions with picture or artist mode

    The command @<code>C-c '@</code> (that is =C-c= followed by a
    single quote) can now also be used to switch to a special
    editing mode for fixed-width sections.  The default mode is
    =artist-mode= which allows you to create ASCII drawings.

    It works like this: Enter the editing mode with
    @<code>C-c '@</code>.  An indirect buffer will be created and
    narrowed to the fixed-width region.  Edit the drawing, and
    press @<code>C-c '@</code> again to exit.

    Lines in a fixed-width region should be preceded by a colon
    followed by at least one space.  These will be removed during
    editing, and then added back when you exit the editing mode.

    Using the command in an empty line will create a new
    fixed-width region.

    This new feature arose from a discussion involving Scott
    Otterson, Sebastian Rose and Will Henney.

*** /org-plot.el/ is now part of Org.

    You can run it by simple calling org-plot/gnuplot.
    Documentation is not yet included with Org, please refer to
    http://github.com/eschulte/org-plot/tree/master until we have
    moved the docs into Org or Worg.

    Thanks to Eric Schulte for this great contribution.

*** Tags can be used to select the export part of a document

    You may now use tags to select parts of a document for
    inclusion into the export, and to exclude other parts.  This
    behavior is governed by two new variables:
    =org-export-select-tags= and =org-export-exclude-tags=.
    These default to =("export")= and =("noexport")=, but can be
    changed, even to include a list of several tags.

    Org first checks if any of the /select/ tags is present in
    the buffer.  If yes, all trees that do not carry one of these
    tags will be excluded.  If a selected tree is a subtree, the
    heading hierarchy above it will also be selected for export,
    but not the text below those headings.  If none of the select
    tags is found anywhere in the buffer, the whole buffer will
    be selected for export.  Finally, all subtrees that are
    marked by any of the /exclude/ tags will be removed from the
    export buffer.

    You may set these tags with in-buffer options
    =EXPORT_SELECT_TAGS= and =EXPORT_EXCLUDE_TAGS=.

    I love this feature.  Thanks to Richard G Riley for coming
    up with the idea.

*** Prefix interpretation when storing remember notes

    The prefix argument to the `C-c C-c' command that finishes a
    remember process is now interpreted differently:

    : C-c C-c       Store the note to predefined file and headline
    : C-u C-c C-c   Like C-c C-c, but immediately visit the note
    :               in its new location.
    : C-1 C-c C-c   Select the storage location interactively
    : C-0 C-c C-c   Re-use the last used location

    This was requested by John Wiegley.

*** Yanking inserts folded subtrees

    If the kill is a subtree or a sequence of subtrees, yanking
    them with =C-y= will leave all the subtrees in a folded
    state.  This basically means, that kill and yank are now
    much more useful in moving stuff around in your outline.  If
    you do not like this, customize the variable
    =org-yank-folded-subtrees=.

    Right now, I am only binding =C-y= to this new function,
    should I modify all bindings of yank?  Do we need to amend
    =yank-pop= as well?

    This feature was requested by John Wiegley.

*** Column view capture tables can have formulas, plotting info

    If you attach formulas and plotting instructions to a table
    capturing column view, these extra lines will now survive an
    update of the column view capture, and any formulas will be
    re-applied to the captured table.  This works by keeping any
    continuous block of comments before and after the actual
    table.

*** In column view, date stamps can be changed with S-cursor keys

    If a property value is a time stamp, S-left and S-right can
    now be used to shift this date around while in column view.

    This was a request by Chris Randle.

*** The note buffer for clocking out now mentions the task
    
    This was a request by Peter Frings.

*** Sorting entries alphabetically ignores TODO keyword and priority

    Numerical and alphanumerical sorting now skips any TODO
    keyword or priority cookie when constructing the comparison
    string.  This was a request by Wanrong Lin.

*** Agenda views can sort entries by TODO state

    You can now define a sorting strategy for agenda entries that
    does look at the TODO state of the entries.  Sorting by TODO
    entry does first separate the non-done from the done states.
    Within each class, the entries are sorted not alphabetically,
    but in definition order.  So if you have a sequence of TODO
    entries defined, the entries will be sorted according to the
    position of the keyword in this sequence.

    This follows an idea and sample implementation by Christian
    Egli.

*** New face =org-scheduled= for entries scheduled in the future.

    This was a request by Richard G Riley.

*** Remember templates for gnus links can now use the :to escape.

    Thanks to Tommy Lindgren for a patch to this effect.
*** The file specification in a remember template may now be a function

    Thanks to Gregory Sullivan for a patch to this effect.

*** Categories in iCalendar export now include local tags

    The locally defined tags are now listed as categories when
    exporting to iCalendar format.  Org's traditional file/tree
    category is now the last category in this list.  Configure
    the variable =org-icalendar-categories= to modify or revert
    this behavior.

    This was a request by Charles Philip Chan.

*** It is now possible to define filters for column view

    The filter can modify the value that will be displayed in a
    column, for example it can cut out a part of a time stamp.
    For more information, look at the variable
    =org-columns-modify-value-for-display-function=.

*** Disabling integer increment during table field copy

    Prefix arg 0 to S-RET does the trick.

    This was a request by Chris Randle.
