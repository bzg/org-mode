* Version 6.01

This is a new major release, mostly because of structural changes
in Org.  However, since this took a while, there is also a long
list of small improvements and some new significant features.

** Overview

   - The Org distribution has a new structure
   - New system for selecting modules to load
   - New archiving mechanism: The Archive Sibling
   - Support for Sebastian Rose's JavaScript org-info.js.
   - Internal links work now better in HTML export
   - Export commands can be done in the background
   - Flexible setting of the time block shown by the clock table
   - Clock table can be included in the agenda
   - Support for ISO week dates (ISO 6801)
   - Tag inheritance can be limited to a subset of all tags
   - Entries can be sorted by TODO keyword
   - And some more small fixes and improvements

** Incompatible changes

*** The Org distribution has a new structure

    In the distribution files as well as in the GIT repository,
    the lisp files are now located in a subdirectory "lisp", and
    the documentation files are located in a subdirectory "doc".
    If you are running Org directly from the unpacked
    distribution archive (zip or tar file, or GIT repository),
    you need to modify your settings for load-path accordingly.

** Details

*** The Org distribution has a new structure

    In the distribution files as well as in the GIT repository,
    the lisp files are now located in a subdirectory "lisp", and
    the documentation files are located in a subdirectory "doc".
    If you are running Org directly from the unpacked
    distribution archive (zip or tar file, or GIT repository),
    you need to modify your settings for load-path accordingly.

*** Loading modules

    Org-mode has now a system for loading modules by simply
    configuring an option that lists all the modules you want to
    use.  Customize the variable `org-modules'.  That variable
    lists both modules that are part of the Org-mode core (and in
    this way part of Emacs), and modules that are contributed
    packages.  Contributed modules will only be available when
    you have installed them properly (most likely by downloading
    the distribution and adding /path/to/orgdir/contrib/lisp to
    your load path).

*** New archiving mechanism: The Archive Sibling

    There is a new method to archive entries in the current file:
    By moving it to a sibling called the /Archive Sibling/.  That
    sibling has the heading "Archive" and also carries the
    ARCHIVE tag.  This can be a great way to do archiving inside
    a project, to get parts of the project out of the way and to
    wait with true archiving (moving to another file) until the
    entire project is done.  Archiving to a sibling keeps much of
    the context, for example inherited tags and approximate tree
    position in tact.

    The key binding for the is "C-c C-x A", and from the agenda
    buffer you can simply use "A".

    Thanks to Ilya Shlyakhter for this rather clever idea.

*** Support for Sebastian Rose's JavaScript org-info.js.

    This fascinating program allows a completely new viewing
    experience for web pages created from Org files.  The same
    document can be viewed in different ways, and switching
    between the views as well as navigation uses single-key
    commands.

    One of the view types is an /Info-like/ interface where you
    can jump through the sections of the document with the `n'
    and `p' keys (and others).  There is also a /folding/
    interface where you can fold the document much like you can
    fold it in org-mode in Emacs, and cycle through the
    visibility both locally and globally.

    To set this up, all you need to do is to make sure that
    org-infojs.el gets loaded (customize the variable org-modules
    to check).  Then add this line to the buffer:

    : #+INFOJS_OPT: view:info

    In that line, you can configure the initial view and other
    settings.  Available views are =info= for the info-like
    interface, and =overview=, =content=, and =showall= for the
    folding interface.  See the manual for more details.  The
    JavaScript program is served from
    http://orgmode.org/org-info.js, and your exported HTML files
    will automatically get it from there.  However, you may want
    to be independent of the existence and stability of
    orgmode.org and install a copy locally.  Then you need to
    change the path from which the script is loaded, either by
    using something like

    : #+INFOJS_OPT: view:info path:../scripts/org-info.js

    or by configuring the variable =org-infojs-options=.

    For details see the documentation provided by Sebastian Rose
    together with org-info.js.

*** Export improvements

    - The export of internal links to HTML now works a lot
      better.  Most internal links that work while editing an Org
      file inside Emacs will now also work the the corresponding
      HTML file.

    - You can run many of the export commands in the background
      by using `C-c C-u C-c C-e' in order to start the process.
      RIght now this will only work if "emacs" is the right
      command to get to your Emacs executable - I hope to make
      this less system dependent in the future.

    Both these are based on requests by Ilya Shlyakhter.

*** Improvements to clocktable

    - The clocktable is now much more flexible and user friendly
      when trying to specify the time block that should be
      considered when constructing the table.

      The =:block= parameter to the table can now look like any
      of these:
      
      | :block       | meaning               |
      |--------------+-----------------------|
      | 2008         | The entire year 2008  |
      | 2008-04      | The month April 2008  |
      | 2008-04-02   | The day April 2, 2008 |
      | 2008-W14     | ISO-Week 14 in 2008   |
      | today        | Today                 |
      | today-5      | The day five days ago |
      | thisweek     | The current week      |
      | thisweek-2   | Two weeks ago         |
      | thismonth    | The current month     |
      | thismonth-12 | Same month, last year |
      | lastmonth    | Same as thismonth-1   |


      What is more, you can now use the =S-left= and =S-right=
      keys to shift the time block around.  The cursor needs to
      be in the =#+BEGIN: clocktable= line for this to work.  If
      the current block is =today=, =S-left= with switch to
      yesterday.  If the current block is =2008-W14=, =S-right=
      will switch to the following week.

    - When the clocktable is collecting from several files, the
      total time for each file will now also be listed.  This was
      a request from Bernt Hansen.

    - If you turn on the new clock report mode with the "R" key in
      the agenda, a clock table will be attached to the agenda,
      showing the clock report for the file scope and time
      interval of the agenda view.  To turn this on permanently,
      configure the variable
      =org-agenda-start-with-clock report-mode=.  To modify the
      properties of the table, in particular the =:maxlevel=
      depth, configure =org-agenda-clockreport-parameter-plist=.

*** Support for ISO week dates (ISO 6801)

    The agenda now shows the ISO week for the displayed dates, in
    the form =W08= for week 8.

    The keys =d=, =w=, =m=, and =y= in the agenda view now accept
    prefix arguments.  Remember that in the agenda, you can
    directly type a prefix argument by typing a number, no need
    to press =C-u= first.  The prefix argument may be used to
    jump directly to a specific day of the year, ISO week, month,
    or year, respectively.  For example, =32 d= jumps to February
    1st, =9 w= to ISO week number 9.  When setting day, week, or
    month view, a year may be encoded in the prefix argument as
    well.  For example, =200712 w= will jump to week 12 in the
    year 2007.  If such a year specification has only one or two
    digits, it will be mapped to the interval 1938-2037.

    When entering a date at the date prompt, you may now also
    specify an ISO week.  For example

    : w4              Monday of week 4
    : fri w4          Friday of week 4
    : w4-5            Same as above
    : 2012 w4 fri     Friday of week 4 in 2012.
    : 2012-W04-5      Same as above

    So far I have not implemented the effect of
    `org-read-date-prefer-future' on this functionality, because
    it seemed too magic for me.  I'd appreciate comments on this
    issue:  Should `org-read-date-prefer-future' also push dates
    into the next year if the week you are entering has already
    passed in the current year?  For consistency I guess this
    should be the case, but I cannot quite wrap my head around
    it.

    I hope but am not entirely convinced that this will behave
    sanely also during the first/last week of a year.  Please
    test extensively and report back.

    This was a request by Thomas Baumann.

*** Improvements in Search View
    
    - Calling search view with a C-u prefix will make it match
      only in TODO entries.

    - The single quote is no longer considered a word character
      during search, so that searching for the word "Nasim" will
      also match in "Nasim's".


*** Misc
    
    - Inheritance of tags can now be limited to a subset of all
      tags, using the variable =org-use-tag-inheritance=.  This
      variable may now be a regular expression or a list to
      select the inherited tags.  Thanks to Michael Ekstrand for
      this excellent proposal.
      
      The regexp option is also implemented for
      =org-use-property-inheritance=, so that you can now select
      properties for inheritance my name.

    - The INHERIT flag to the function =org-entry-get= can be set
      to the symbol =selective=.  If this is the case, then the
      value of the property will be retrieved using inheritance
      if and only if the setting in
      =org-use-property-inheritance= selects the property for
      inheritance.

    - There are now special faces for the date lines in the
      agenda/timeline buffers, and another special face for days
      that fall on a weekend: =org-agenda-date= and
      =org-agenda-date-weekend=.  Both these faces are initially
      similar to the =org-agenda-structure= face, but you can
      customize them freely.

    - When an entry already has a scheduling or deadline time
      stamp, calling `C-c C-s' or `C-c C-d', respectively, will
      now use that old date as the default, and you can can use
      the "++4d" syntax to invoke shifts relative to that default
      date.  Simply pressing RET at the prompt will keep the
      default date, not switch to today.
      
      This was an omission in the earlier implementation, spotted
      by Wanrong Lin.  Thanks!
      
    - File names in remember templates can be relative, if they
      are, they will be interpreted relative to =org-directory=.

    - The handling of the clipboard when inserting into remember
      templates is now much better, and gives more control on what
      should be inserted with new %-escapes:
      
      - =%c= - Now always insert the head of the kill ring, never
        the X clipboard.

      - =%x= - Insert the content of the X clipboard. This is the
	first non-empty value from the PRIMARY, SECONDARY and
	CLIPBOARD X clipboards. 
	
      - =%^C= - This allows the user to choose between any of the
	clipboard values available, the kill ring head, and the
	initial region if set.  
	
      - =%^L= - Like =%^C=, but this inserts an org link using the
	selected value.
	
      Thanks to James TD Smith for this patch.
	
    - Table export to an internal file can now use a format
      specification, similar to the formats that are used by
      orgtbl radio tables.  The default format is in the variable
      =org-table-export-default-format=.  You can use properties
      =TABLE_EXPORT_FILE= and =TABLE_EXPORT_FORMAT= to specify the
      file name to which the export should go, and a local
      format.  For example:
     
      : :PROPERTIES:
      : :TABLE_EXPORT_FILE: ~/xx.txt
      : :TABLE_EXPORT_FORMAT: orgtbl-to-generic :splice t :sep "\t"
      : :END:

      Thanks to James TD Smith for this patch.

    - Entries can be sorted by TODO keyword, and the order is given
      by the definition sequence of the TODO keywords in the
      variable =org-todo-keywords=, or in the =#+TODO= line.  Use
      the "o" key when sorting with =C-c ^=.
      
      Thanks to James TD Smith for this patch.


* Version 5.23

   - The variable `org-time-stamp-rounding-minutes' is now a list
     of two values - if you have configured this variable before,
     please do it again.

** Details

*** New keyword search agenda view

    `C-c a s' now invokes a special agenda view that can be used
    to search notes by keyword and regular expressions.  In
    particular, it does not require a single regular expression
    or string to search for, but it can search for a number
    keywords or regexps that can occur in arbitrary sequence in
    the entry.  The search knows the boundaries of an entry, can
    use simple Boolean logic and is reasonably fast.  For
    example, the search string

    : +computer +wifi -ethernet -{8\.11[bg]}

    will search for note entries that contain the keywords
    =computer= and =wifi=, but not the keyword =ethernet=, and
    which are also not matched by the regular expression
    "8\.11[bg]", meaning to exclude both 8.11b and 8.11g.  If the
    first character of the search string is an asterisk, the
    search will only look at headlines - otherwise it will look
    at the headine and the text below it, up to the next
    (possibly sub-) heading.

    The command searches all agenda files, and in addition the
    files listed in =org-agenda-text-search-extra-files=.
    
    I find it very useful to define a custom command to do such
    a search only in a limited number of files (my notes files),
    like this:

    : ("N" "Search notes" search ""
    :   ((org-agenda-files '("~/org/notes.org" "~/org/computer.org"))
    :    (org-agenda-text-search-extra-files nil)))

*** Many new extensions available in the CONTRIB directory

    - Phil Jackson's /org-irc.el/ is now part of the Org-mode
      core, which means it will become part of Emacs soon.

    - The new development model already starts to pay off, a
      number of interesting extensions are now part of the
      distribution.  Check the file CONTRIB/README for a list.

    - There is a new variable `org-default-extensions'.
      Configuring this variable makes it *very* easy to load
      these default extensions - eventually this will be expanded
      to cover contributed extensions as well.

*** New remember template option: pre-selection contexts

    - Remember template definitions now allow six elements.  The
      last element defines the contexts in which the template
      should be offered.  It can be a list of major modes, a
      function, =t= or =nil=.  If it is a list of major-mode, the
      template will be available only when =org-remember= is
      called from a buffer in one of these modes.  If it is a
      function, the template will be offered only if the function
      returns `t' when called in the current buffer.  A value of
      =t= or =nil= for this element means select this template in
      any context.

      One possible application for this would be to have several
      templates all using the same selection letter, and choosing
      the right one based on context.  For example, think of
      tasks describing a bug in a source code file.  With the
      following configuration we make sure that the bug reports
      are filed into the appropriate sections of the target file.
      
: (setq org-remember-templates
:  '(("Elisp" ?b "* %a\n\n%i%?" "~/bugs.org" "Elisp bugs" (emacs-lisp-mode))
:    ("C Bugs" ?b "* %a\n\n%i%?" "~/bugs.org" "C bugs" (cc-mode))))
     
      See (info "(org)Remember templates") for details.

*** Modifying list/headline status of a line

    - `C-c -' has now more functions:
      + In a table, add a hline as before
      + In an item list, cycle bullet type as before
      + In a normal line, turn it into an item
      + In a headline, turn it into an item
      + If there is an active region, turn each line into an item.
        But if the first region line is already an item, remove
        item markers from all lines.

      Based on proposals by Bastien.

    - `C-c *' has now more functions
      + in a table, recompute, as before
      + in a normal line, convert it to a sub heading.
      + at an item, convert it into a subheading
      + if there is an active region, convert all lines in the
        region to headlines.  However, if the first lie already is
        a heading, remove the stars from all lines int he region.

      Based on proposals by Bastien.
 
*** Changes related to time stamps

    - The value variable =org-time-stamp-rounding-minutes= is now
      a list of two values.  The first applies when creating a new
      time stamp.  The second applies when modifying a timestamp
      with S-up/down.  The default for this new task is 5 minutes,
      but 15 may also be a very good value for many people.  If
      S-up/down is used on a time stamp where the minute part is
      not compatible with this granularity it will be made so.
      You can bypass this by using a prefix argument to exactly
      specify the number of minutes to shift.

      This was a proposal by Adam Spiers.

    - New repeaters that shift a date relative to today, or that
      make sure that the next date is in the future.  For example:

      :** TODO Call Father
      :   DEADLINE: <2008-02-10 Sun ++1w>
      :   Marking this DONE will shift the date by at least one week,
      :   but also by as many weeks as it takes to get this date into
      :   the future.  However, it stays on a Sunday, even if you called
      :   and marked it done on Saturday.
      :** TODO Check the batteries in the smoke detectors
      :   DEADLINE: <2005-11-01 Tue .+1m>
      :   Marking this DONE will shift the date to one month after
      :   today.

      Proposed by Wanrong Lin and Rainer Stengle.

*** New parameters for dynamic blocks ad the clock table

    - There is a new =:link= parameter for the clocktable.  When
      set, the headlines listed in the table will be links to the
      original headlines.

    - There is a new =:content= parameter that is passed to the
      writer function of the dynamic block.  Use this parameter
      to pass the previous content of the block to the writer
      function, in case you want to make the outcome dependent on
      the previous content.

*** Limiting iCalendar export to fewer entries

    - New way to limit iCalendar export to the entries captured in
      an agenda view.  This is done by "writing" the agenda view
      using `C-x C-w' to a file with extension .ics.

      This was a request by Kyle Sexton.

*** Misc

   - Due to a popular revolt shortly after the 5.22 release,
     =M-RET= can again be used to split a line so that the rest
     of the line becomes the new heading.  However, if you do
     this in a heading containing tags, the tags will stay in the
     old line.

     Customize the variable =org-M-RET-may-split-line= if you
     don't want this command to split a line in the middle.  The
     same variable also influences line splitting in items and in
     tables.

   - There are three new hooks:

     =org-follow-link-hook=: runs after following a link
     =org-publish-before-export-hook=: runs before export
     =org-publish-after-export-hook=: runs after export
     
* Version 5.22

** Incompatible changes

   - The variable `org-log-done' is now less complex.
   - The in-buffer settings for logging have changed.  Some
     options no longer exists, some new ones have been added.

** Details

*** Changes to logging progress

    There is now more control over which state changes are being
    logged in what way.  Please read carefully the corresponding
    sections in the manual.  Basically: 

    - The variable `org-log-done' has been simplified, it no
      longer influences logging state changes and clocking out.
    - There is a new variable for triggering note-taking when
      clocking out an item: `org-log-note-clock-out'.
    - Logging of state changes now has to be configured on a
      pre-keyword basis, either in `org-todo-keywords' or in the
      #+TODO in-buffer setting.
    - These per-keyword settings allow more control.  For example

      : WAIT(w@)    Record a note when entering this state.
      : WAIT(w!)    Record a timestamp when entering this state.
      : WAIT(w@/!)  Recore a note when entering and timestamp
      :             when leaving this state.  This is great for
      :             getting a record when switching *back* from
      :              WAIT to TODO.
      : WAIT(/!)    Record a timestamp when leaving this state.
      :             Here we not even define a fast access
      :             character, but just the logging stuff.

    This was triggered by requests from Wanrong Lin and Bernt Hansen.

*** Other

   - M-RET no longer brakes a line in the middle, it will make a
     new line after the current or (if cursor is at the beginning
     of the line) before the current line.

   - RET, when executed in a headline after the main text and
     before the tags will leave the tags in the current line and
     create a new line below the current one.

* Version 5.21

  Bug fixes, in particular the long-hunted bug about wrong window
  positions after pressing SPACE in the agenda.  Hopefully this
  is really fixed.

* Version 5.20

** Overview

*** Remember/Refile/Goto

    - The use of prefix arguments for the commands `org-remember'
      and `org-refile' has been normalized.

    - The clock can now safely be used in a remember buffer.
      
    - The variable `org-remember-use-refile-when-interactive'
      introduced only in 5.19 is already obsolete.  Please use
      `org-remember-interactive-interface' instead.

    - It is no longer necessary to update the refiling targets.

    - Automatic isearch in `org-goto'.

    - Outline-path-completion as alternative org-goto interface.

*** Misc

    - Checkboxes now work hierarchically.

    - `C-k' can now behave specially in headlines.

    - Repeater for tasks in plain timestamps.

    - All clock intervals of an item show in agenda/timeline.
      
    - New parameter =:step= for clocktable, to get daily reports.

    - Never loose a repeaded scheduled item from the agenda.

    - Archiving a subtree now stores the outline path in a property.

    - Links to messages in Apple Mail.

    - Bug fixes.

** Incompatible Changes
   
   - The variable `org-remember-use-refile-when-interactive'
     introduced only in 5.19 is already obsolete.  Please use
     `org-remember-interactive-interface' instead.

** Details

*** Remember/Refile/Goto

    - The use of prefix arguments for the commands `org-remember'
      and `org-refile' has been normalized:

      + when called without prefix argument, the command does its
        normal job, starting a remember note or refiling a tree.

      + when called with a single C-u prefix, these commands can be
        used to select a target location and to jump there.  In
        the case of `org-remember', you will be prompted for a
        template and then Emacs jumps to the default target
        location or this template.  In the case of `org-refile',
        you select a location from the refile target list and jump
        there.

      + when called with two prefixes (`C-u C-u'), the command
        jumps to the location last used for storing a note or a
        moved tree.

    - When the clock is running inside an remember buffer, storing
      the remember buffer with `C-c C-c' will automatically clock
      out.  This was inspired by a request by Rainer Stengle. 
      
    - The variable `org-remember-use-refile-when-interactive'
      introduced only in 5.19 is already obsolete.  Please use
      `org-remember-interactive-interface' instead.  This new
      variable does select the interface that is used to select
      the target for a remember note in an interactive way.
      Possible values are:

      + `outline': Use an outline of the document to select a
        location.  
      + `outline-path-completion': Use completion of an outline
        path to select a location.
      + `refile': Offer the `org-refile-targets' as possible
        targets.

    - It is no longer necessary to update the refiling targets -
      they are always current.

    - In `org-goto', typing characters now automatically starts
      isearch from the beginning of the buffer.  The isearch is
      special also because it only matches in headline.  This
      goes some way toward saving org-goto from being removed
      from Org-mode.  Thanks to Piotr Zielinski for the code, and
      sorry that it took me so long to put it in.  If you prefer
      to use single letters n,p,f,b,u,q for navigation as before,
      configure the variable `org-goto-auto-isearch'.

    - Outline-path-completion is now available as an alternative
      interface in the command `org-goto'.  Please select the
      default interface you'd like to use with the new variable
      `org-goto-interface'.  You can then select the alternative
      interface with a prefix argument to `C-c C-j' (org-goto).  I
      am considering to make outline-path-completion the default
      interface.  Comments?


*** Misc

    - Checkboxes now work hierarchically.  When a plain-list item
      with a checkbox has children with checkboxes, the status of
      the item's checkbox is calculated from the children, each
      time a checkbox is toggled with C-c C-c.  Thanks to Miguel
      A. Figueroa-Villanueva for a patch to this effect.

    - There is a new variable `org-special-ctrl-k'.  When set,
      `C-k' will behave specially in headlines:

      + When the cursor is at the beginning of a headline, kill
        the entire line and possible the folded subtree below the
        line.
      + When in the middle of the headline text, kill the
        headline up to the tags.
      + When after the headline text, kill the tags.

      This is following a proposal by Piotr Zielinski.

    - You can now also have a plain (as opposed to deadline or
      scheduled) repeater timestamp in a task.  Switching the task
      to DONE will now also shift a plain time stamp.  This was a
      request by Austin Frank.

    - If an entry is clocked multiple times, it will now show up
      several times in the agenda and timeline buffers, when
      log-mode is on.  This was a proposal by Jurgen Defurne.
      
    - The clock table accepts a new parameter =:step=.  This
      parameter can be `day' or `week' and will result in separate
      tables for each day or week in the requested time interval.
      This was triggered by a proposal by Sacha Chua in her [[http://sachachua.com/wp/2007/12/30/clocking-time-with-emacs-org/][blog]].

    - A time-stamp with a repeater now no longer refers to the
      date *closest* to the current day.  Instead, it means either
      today or the most recent match.  This change makes sure that
      overdue scheduled or deadline items never disappear from the
      agenda.  With the previous convention, an overdue scheduled
      item would disappear.  For example, a weekly item scheduled
      for Sunday would appear as overdue until Wednesday, and the
      suddenly disappear until next Sunday.  Now the item will
      show up as "Sched 7x" on Saturday.  From Sunday on it will
      be in the list as "Scheduled", i.e. old sins will be
      forgiven.  This follows a request by Warong, Dennis and
      Bernt.

    - Archiving a subtree now creates an additional property,
      =ARCHIVE_OLPATH=.  This property contains the "path" in the
      outline tree to the archived entry, as it was in the
      original file.  For example, archiving =Fix the door= in the
      following hierarchy
      
      : * Tasks
      : ** HOME
      : *** Garage
      : **** Fix the door
      
      will file is with the following property
      
      : :ARCHIVE_PATH: Task/HOME/Garage
      
      Note that you can configure (i.e. limit) the information
      that gets stored upon archiving with the variable
      `org-archive-save-context-info'.

    - New file `org-mac-message.el' by John Wiegley to create
      links for messages in Apple Mail, and to follow these
      links.

    - Bug fixes.

* Version 5.19

** Overview

   - Column view can list the clocked times of a subtree.

   - Storing remember notes can use the `org-refile' interface.

   - Storing remember notes no longer produced empty lines.

   - Moving subtrees now folds all siblings of the subtree.

   - New variable `org-agenda-todo-keyword-format'.

   - Hack to allow brackets in link descriptions.

   - Clocking into an entry can enforce a specific TODO state.

   - EXPORT_FILE_NAME may be an absolute file name with "~".

   - Bug fixes, lots of them.

** Details

   - A new special column definition lists the sum of all CLOCK
     entries in a subtree.  For example

     : #+COLUMNS: %20ITEM %10Time_Estimate{:} %CLOCKSUM

     will allow you to compare estimated times (as given in the
     Time_Estimate property) with the clocked times.  This was a
     request by Bernt Hansen.

   - Storing remember notes can now use the `org-refile'
     interface instead of the `org-goto' interface (see the
     variable `org-remember-use-refile-when-interactive').
     Nothing will change if the note is stored immediately after
     pressing `C-c C-c' in the =*Remember*= buffer.  But if you
     have chosen (e.g. by pressing `C-u C-c C-c') to
     interactively select the filing location (file and
     headline), the refile interface will be used instead.  I am
     excited about this change, because the `org-goto' interface
     is basically a failure, at least for this application.  Note
     that in any case the refile interface has to be configured
     first by customizing `org-refile-targets'.

   - Notes inserted with remember now remove any whitespace
     before and after the note before being pasted, so that there
     will be no empty lines inserted together with the note.  We
     could invent special syntax in remember templates to allow
     creating empty lines before a note - is there anyone who'd
     want this?

   - Moving subtrees now folds all siblings of the subtree.  This
     is the only reasonably simple way I could find to avoid the
     reported inconsistencies in the folding state of the outline
     tree after moving entries.  There are reasons to like this
     new behavior, because it easily visualizes where the tree is
     located after the move.  Still, not everyone might be happy
     with this.  Massive complaining would be needed to make me
     fix this.

   - New variable `org-agenda-todo-keyword-format' to specify the
     width of the TODO keyword field in the agenda display.  Use
     it to get things to line up better.  This was a proposal by
     Rainer Stengele.

   - If a link description inserted with `C-c C-l' contains
     brackets, the brackets will now be converted into curly
     braces.  This looks similar enough.  Supporting brackets in
     link descriptions is, for technical reasons too long to
     explain here, complex.

   - The new option `org-clock-in-switch-to-state' can be set to
     a TODO state that will be enforced when the clock is started
     on an entry.  This follows an idea by Sacha Chua.

   - The EXPORT_FILE_NAME property may now also be an absolute
     file name, and it may contain abbreviations like "~" for the
     users home directory.  This was requested by Adam Spiers.

   - Bug fixes, lots of them.

* Version 5.18

  Minor fixes.

* Version 5.17

** Details

*** Whitespace

    - When cutting, pasting, or moving subtrees and items, the
      empty lines *before* the subtree/item now belong to the
      part and will be moved with it.  There is one exception to
      this rule: If the first child is moved down (or,
      equivalently, the second is moved up), the amount of empty
      lines *above* the first child to be moved along with it is
      limited by the number of empty lines *below* it.  This
      sounds complicated, but it allows to have extra empty space
      before the first child and still have good behavior of the
      subtree motion commands.

    - Plain lists items work the same.

    I believe we have finally nailed this one.  Thanks to Daniel
    Pittman for bring this up again and to Eric Schulte for
    pointing out that it is the empty lines *before* an entry
    that really count.

    This change was non-trivial, please give it a good test and
    let me know about any problems.

*** Remember

    - The new command `org-remember-goto-last-stored' will jump
      to the location of the remember note stored most recently.
      If you have `org-remember' on a key like `C-c r', then you
      can go to the location with a double prefix arg: `C-u C-u
      C-c r'.  This was a proposal by Rainer Stengele.

    - Template items that are being prompted for can now specify
      a default value and a completion table.  Furthermore,
      previous inputs at a specific prompt are captured in a
      history variable.  For example:

      : %^{Author|Roald Dahl|Thomas Mann|Larry Niven}

      will prompt for an author name.  Pressing RET without
      typing anything will select "Roald Dahl".  Completion will
      give you any of the three names.  And a history will be
      kept, so you can use the arrow keys to get to previous
      input.  The history is tied to the prompt.  By using the
      same prompt in different templates, you can build a history
      across templates.  The ideas for this came from proposals
      by Bastien and Adam.

    - When a remember template contains the string `%!', the note
      will be stored immediately after all template parts have
      been filled in, so you don't even have to press `C-c
      C-c'. The was a proposal by Adam Spiers.

*** Refile

    - `org-refile-targets' has a new parameter to specify a
      maximum level for target selection.  Thanks to Wanrong Lin
      for this proposal.

    - When the new option `org-refile-use-outline-path' is set,
      refile targets will be presented like a file path to the
      completion interface: "level 1/level 2/level 3".  This
      may be the fastest interface yet to get to a certain
      outline entry.  Do we need to use this interface in other
      places?  Thanks to Jose Ruiz for this proposal.

* Version 5.16

** Details

*** Restriction lock on agenda scope

    You can now permanently lock the agenda construction to a
    certain scope, like a file or a subtree.  So instead of
    pressing "<" for each command in the agenda dispatcher, you
    only once select a restriction scope.  All subsequent agenda
    commands will than respect this restriction.  For example,
    you can use this at work, to limit agendas to your work file
    or tree, and at home to limit to the home file or tree.  Or
    you can use it during the day in order to focus in on certain
    projects.

    You select a scope with the command `C-c C-x <', which
    restricts to the current subtree.  When called with a `C-u'
    prefix, the restriction is to the current file.  You can also
    make restrictions from the speedbar frame, see below.

    When making a new restriction and an agenda window is
    currently visible, it will immediately be updated to reflect
    the new scope.  TO if you like you can display an agenda view
    and then watch it change in various scopes.

    To get rid of the restriction, use the command "C-c C-x >".
    Or press ">" in the agenda dispatcher.  Also, and use of "<"
    in the dispatcher will disable the restriction lock and
    select a new restriction.

    Thanks to Rick Moynihan for triggering this development. 

*** Imenu and Speedbar support

    - Org-mode now supports Imenu.  For example, with the setting

      : (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 
      :    (lambda () 'imenu-add-to-menubar "Imenu"))

      a menu will be created in each Org-mode buffer that
      provides access to all level 1 and level 2 headings.  The
      depth of the menu can be set with the variable
      `org-imenu-depth'.

    - org-mode now supports Speedbar.  This means that you can
      drill into the first and second level headlines of an
      Org-mode file right from the speedbar frame.

    - You can set a restriction lock for the Org-mode agenda to a
      file or a subtree directly from the speedbar frame.  Just
      press "<" with the cursor on an Org-mode file or subtree to
      set the lock and immediately update the agenda if it is
      visible.  Use ">" to get rid of the lock again.

* Version 5.15

** Details

   - There are new special properties TIMESTAMP and TIMESTAMP_IA.
     These can be used to access the first keyword-less active
     and inactive timestamp in an entry, respectively.

   - New variable `org-clock-heading-function'.  It can be set to
     a function that creates the string shown in the mode line
     when a clock is running.  Thanks to Tom Weissmann for this
     idea.

   - Bug fixes.

* Version 5.14

** Overview

   + Remember and related stuff
     - New command `org-refile' to quickly move a note.
     - Easy way to jump to the target location of remember template.
     - New %-escapes in remember templates: %c %(...) and %[...]
     - `org-remember-insinuate' simplifies remember setup

   + Emphasis and Font-lock stuff
     - Stacked emphasis is no longer allowed.
     - You may finally emphasize a single character like ~*a*~.
     - Font-lock now can hide the emphasis markers
     - Text in the "=" emphasis is exported verbatim
     - There is a new emphasis marker "~" for verbatim text
     - Constructs treated specially by the exporters can be highlighted

   + Properties and Column view
     - More control over which properties use inheritance
     - CATEGORY="work" can now be used in a tags/property search
     - the {+} summary type can specify a printf-style output format
     - New currency summary type {$}

   + The date/time prompt
     - While entering data, watch live the current interpretation.
     - The date prompt now prefers to select the future
     - Easier modification of time in an existing time stamp.

   + Export
     - You can now export some special strings in HTML, like "..."
     - #+EMAIL: may contain several email addresses

   + Agenda
     - In the agenda, a few keys have changed: `g', `G', and `e'.

   + Miscellaneous
     - Class-dependent sectioning structures in LaTeX export.
     - Radio-lists modeled after the radio tables.
     - The default for `org-ellipsis' is back to nil
     - Support for pabbrev-mode
     - New variable `org-show-entry-below'.

** Incompatible changes

   - If you have customized the variable `org-emphasis-alist' or
     org-export-emphasis-alist', you need to do it again by first
     canceling your customization and then adding it again.

   - I know that some people have defined their own private helper
     functions to select a specific remember template, without being
     prompted, like this:

     : (defun my-remember-template-n ()
     :    (interactive)
     :    (org-remember ?n))

     You need to modify this.  The character selecting the template
     must now be the /second/ argument to `org-remember':

     : (defun my-remember-template-n ()
     :    (interactive)
     :    (org-remember nil ?n))

   - `C-c C-w' now refiles an entry.  To get a sparse tree of
     deadlines, use `C-c / d' instead.

** Details

*** Remember and related stuff

    - New command `org-refile' to quickly move a note to a
      different place.  It is bound to `C-c C-w'.  The foremost
      application might be to put a note or task captured with
      `remember' into the proper list or project.  The command
      offers a list of possible refiling targets for completion.
      These are headings under which the entry will be inserted
      as a subitem.  By default, this will offer all top-level
      headings in the current buffer, but you can configure the
      variable `org-refile-targets' to get more complex
      definitions.  For example:

      : (setq org-refile-targets '((nil . (:level . 2))))

      selects all level 2 headlines in the current buffer as
      targets.  And

      : (setq org-refile-targets
      :      '((org-agenda-files . (:tag . "refile"))))

      searches all agenda files and selects headlines that are
      explicitly marked with the tag :refile: .  Note that the
      list of targets is built upon first use only, to rebuilt
      it, call the command `C-c C-w' with a double prefix
      argument.

      This is based on an idea and example implementation by Max
      Mikhanosha.  Many thanks Max.

    - You can now use a C-u prefix on `org-remember' to jump to
      the location where a specific templates stores its notes.
      For example, if you have `org-remember' bound to `C-c r',
      then `C-u C-c r n' will get you to the file and headline
      given in the template associated with the letter "n".

      This was proposed by someone, but I have lost track who.
      Sorry, and thanks anyway.

    - New %-escapes in remember templates:

      : %c     insert the current clipboard, like C-y would do
      : %(..)  evaluate Lisp expression and insert the result
      : %[..]  include file

      Thanks to Adam Spiers and Tim O'Callaghan.

    - New function `org-remember-insinuate' that makes is easier
      to set Org-mode specific values for remember variables.
      Thanks to Michael Olson for this proposal.  It is
      equivalent to:

      : (require 'remember)
      : (setq remember-annotation-functions '(org-remember-annotation))
      : (setq remember-handler-functions '(org-remember-handler))
      : (add-hook 'remember-mode-hook 'org-remember-apply-template))

      You might still want to set `org-default-notes-file' to
      provide a default for templates without a file, and
      `org-directory' to show where to find other org files.

*** Emphasis and Font-lock stuff

    - Stacked emphasis like ~*/bold italic/*~ is no longer allowed.

    - You may finally emphasize a single character like ~*a*~.

    - Font-lock now can hide the emphasis markers, just like Muse
      does.  Configure the variable `org-hide-emphasis-markers'
      if you want this.  Showing the characters continues to be
      the default in Org-mode.

    - Text in the "=" emphasis is now exported verbatim, i.e. no
      further parsing and interpretation of this text takes place.  So
      you can write ~=quoted *xxx* a_x = b=~.  This and the following
      point implement a request by Daniel Clemente.

    - There is a new emphasis marker "~" which marks text to be
      exported verbatim, without special formatting.  Inside an
      org-mode file, this text is highlighted with the org-verbatim
      face.  I am not happy with the face yet (currently is is like
      org-code, but underlined), please suggest a better one.

    - Whether an emphasis environment is verbatim or not is now an
      extra flag in the variable `org-emphasis-alist'.  If you have
      configured this variable, do it again by first canceling your
      customization to revert to the default, and then adding it
      again.

    - New variable `org-highlight-latex-fragments-and-specials'.
      When turned on, Org-mode will highlight all strings that
      are treated in a special way by the exporters.  This is
      great for export-oriented writing, but maybe a bit noisy
      for note taking, so this feature is off by default.

*** Properties and Column view

    - `org-use-property-inheritance' may now also be a list of
      property names that should be treated with inheritance
      during searches.

    - CATEGORY="work" can now be used in a tags/property search,
      even if the category is not specified as a property in the
      entry, but rather is inherited or derived from #+CATEGORY.
      Thanks to Adam, Tim, and Bastien for an interesting
      discussion around this issue.

    - Summary type improvements in column view.
      * The {+} summary type can specify a printf-style output
        format for computed values like this: {+;%5.2f}
	This was triggered by a report by Levin.
      * New currency summary type {$}, which so far is just a
        shorthand for {+;%.2f}.  Do we need to have a currency
        symbol in front of each value.  Scott Jaderholm asked for
        this, but I am not sure if this is already what he meant.

*** The date/time prompt

    There have been several small but *very* useful additions to
    the date prompt.

    - While entering data at the date prompt, the current
      interpretation of your input is shown next to your input in
      the minibuffer.  I find this great to understand how the
      input works.  If you find the extra stuff in the minibuffer
      annoying, turn it off with `org-read-date-display-live'.

    - The date prompt now prefers to select the future.  If you
      enter a date without a month, and the day number is before
      today (for example, on the 16th of the month you enter
      "9"), Org-mode will assume next month.  Similarly, if you
      enter a month and no year, next year will be assumed if the
      entered month is before the current, for example if you
      enter "May" in September.  Thanks to John Rakestraw for
      this great suggestion.  If you find it confusing, turn it
      off with `org-read-date-prefer-future'.

    - When modifying an existing date using `C-c .' at the stamp,
      the time or time range in the stamp are now offered as
      default input at the prompt.  This goes a long way to
      simplifying the modification of an existing date.  Thanks
      to Adam Spiers for this proposal.

*** Export (all implemented by Bastien...)

    - You can now export special strings in HTML.  Here is the
      list of newly performed conversions:

      | Org | Description                        | HTML     |
      |-----+------------------------------------+----------|
      | ~\\-~ | double backslash followed by minus | &shy;    |
      | ~--~  | two dashes (minuses)               | &ndash;  |
      | ~---~ | three dashes (minuses)             | &mdash;  |
      | ~...~ | three dots                         | &hellip; |

      You can turn this globally on or off with
      `org-export-with-special-strings' or locally with "-:t" or
      "-:nil" in the #+OPTIONS line.  Thanks to Adam Spiers for
      starting the discussion, and thanks to Daniel Clemente and
      William Henney for relevant inputs.

    - Comma-separated emails in #+EMAIL: are correctly exported.
      Thanks to Raman for pointing out this omission.

*** Agenda

    - In the agenda, a few keys have changed
      : g  does now the same a "r", refresh current display,
      :    because "g" is the Emacs standard for "refresh"
      : G  toggle the time grid, used to be "g"
      : e  Execute another agenda command, pretty much the same as
      :    `C-c a', but shorter and keep the same agenda window.

*** Miscellaneous (much of it from Bastien)

    - You can now select the sectioning structure of your LaTeX
      export by setting it either globally
      (`org-export-latex-default-class') or locally in each Org
      file (with #+LaTeX_CLASS: myclass).  You can also customize
      the list of available classes and their sectioning
      structures through the new `org-export-latex-classes'
      option.  Thanks to Daniel for discussions and suggestion on
      this issue.

    - You can send and receive radio lists in HTML,
      LaTeX or TeXInfo, just as you send and receive radio
      tables.  Check the documentation for details and examples.

    - The default for `org-ellipsis' is back to nil, some people
      seem to have had problems with the face as a default.

    - Support for pabbrev-mode, needs pabbrev version 1.1.  Thanks
      to Phillip Lord for adapting his package to make this
      possible.

    - New variable `org-show-entry-below' to force context-showing
      commands to expose the body of a headline that is being
      shown.  Thanks to Harald Weis for pointing out this omission.


* Version 5.13i

** Details

   - On the date/time prompt, you can now also answer with
     something like +2tue to pick the second tuesday from today.
     This was a proposal by Sacha Chua.

   - When interpopating into Lisp formulas in the spreadsheet,
     the values of constants and properties are no longer
     enclosed into parenthesis.  When interpolating for calc,
     this still happens in order to allow expressions in
     constants.  This problem was reported by Eddward DeVilla.

   - When a directory is listed in `org-agenda-files', all files
     with extension matched by the new variable
     `org-agenda-file-regexp' in that directory will be agenda
     files.

   - Bug fixes.

** Details

*** Bug fixes and improvements in column view

    - All the bugs described by Scott Jaderholm have been fixed
      (at least I hope so...).

    - You can now capture a column view into a dynamic block, for
      exporting or printing it.  The column view can be

      + global, i.e. for the entire file
      + local, i.e. for the subtree where the dynamic block is
      + from an entry with a specific :ID: property.

      You can identify the entry whose column view you want to
      capture by assigning an :ID: property, and use that property
      in the dynamic block definition.  For example:

      : * Planning
      :   :PROPERTIES:
      :     :ID: planning-overview
      :   :END:
      :
      : [...]
      :
      : * The column view
      : #+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id "planning-overview"
      :
      : #+END:

      Use `C-c C-x r' to insert such a dynamic block, and you will
      be prompted for the ID.

    - When the current column format displays TODO keyword,
      priority or tags, these parts are stripped from the content
      of the ITEM column, making for more compact and readable
      entries.  When any of these "properties" are not listed in
      the current column format, they are instead retained in the
      ITEM column.

    - You can now also edit the ITEM column with `e'.

*** The agenda dispatcher

    - Instead of pressing `1' to restrict an agenda command to
      the current buffer, or `0' to restrict it to the current
      subtree or region, you can now also press `<' once or
      twice, respectively.  This frees up `1' and `0' for user
      commands, a request by Bastien.  In fact, "<" cycles
      through different restriction states.  "1" and "0" are
      still available for backward compatibility, until you bind
      them to custom commands.

    - The access code to custom agenda commands can now contain
      several characters, effectively allowing to bundle several
      similar commands into a sub-keymap.  This follows an
      excellent proposal by Adam Spiers.  For example:

      : (setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      :   '(("h" . "HOME + Name tag searches") ; describe prefix "h"
      :     ("hl" tags "+HOME+Lisa")
      :     ("hp" tags "+HOME+Peter")
      :     ("hk" tags "+HOME+Kim")))

    - The user function option in org-agenda-custom-commands may
      now also be a lambda expression, following a request by
      Adam Spiers.

*** Sorting improvements

    We are using a new routine for sorting entries, courtesy of
    John Wiegley.  Many thanks to John.

    - You can define your own function to extract a sorting key
      and in this way sort entries by anything you like.

    - Entries can now be sorted according to the value of a
      property.

    - Plain lists can be sorted.

*** HTML <div> structure

    There is now a <div>-based structure in exported HTML.

    - The table of context is wrapped into a div with a class
      "table-of-contents".

    - The outline structure is embedded in <div> elements with
      classes "outline-1", "outline-2" etc.

    - The postamble, containing the author information and the
      date is wrapped into a div with class "postamble".

    I am not sure if the class names are the best choice, let me
    know if there are more "canonical" choices.

    Thanks to Mike Newman and Cezar for input, and in particular
    to Mike for his clearly formulated specification.

*** Other stuff

    - New variable `org-agenda-window-frame-fractions' to
      customize the size limits of the agenda window in the case
      that you display the agenda window by reorganizing the
      frame.

    - Drawers can be set on a per-file basis using

      : #+DRAWERS: HIDDEN STATE PROPERTIES

      This will define the drawers :HIDDEN: and :STATE:.
      The :PROPERTY: drawer should always be part of this list, or
      your properties will not be folded away.
      Thanks to Richard G. Riley for this proposal.

    - `org-agenda-fontify-priorities' may now also be an
      association list of priorities and faces, to specify the
      faces of priorities in the agenda individually.

    - The variable `org-export-with-property-drawer' no longer
      exists, please use `org-export-with-drawers' instead.  Also,
      the corresponding switch in the #+OPTIONS line has changed
      from "p" to "d".  Thanks to Bastien for pointing out that we
      needed to handle not only the property drawer.

    - M-up and M-down now move the current line up and down (if
      not at a headline, item or table).  Among other things you
      can use this to re-order properties in the drawer.  This was
      a proposal by Bastien.

    - New variable `org-agenda-todo-ignore-with-date', based on a
      request by Wanrong Lin.

    - Aborting remember template selection with C-g now kills the
      remember buffer and restores the old window configuration.
      This was a request by Nuutti Kotivuori.

* Version 5.12

** Overview

   - Remember templates can now have name.
   - `C-c C-k' will abort taking a note (remember of log)
   - `C-c C-x C-w' and `C-c C-x M-w' now accept a prefix arg.
   - Lines in the agenda can be fontified according to priority.
   - New variable `org-scheduled-past-days'.
   - New variables `org-agenda-deadline-leaders' and
     `org-agenda-scheduled-leaders'.
   - New sparse tree function `org-sparse-tree'.
   - The variable `org-ellipsis' now defaults to `org-link'.
   - The #+OPTIONS line has a new option "tags".
   - New variable `org-use-property-inheritance'.

** Incompatible Changes

   - `C-c /' now calls `org-sparse-tree'.

** Details

   - Remember templates can now have a template name as the first
     element.  The name will be listed along with the selection
     character when prompting for a template.  It is best to have
     the name start with the selection character, for example if
     you use ("Note" "n"), you will be prompted like "[n]ote".
     Thanks to Matiyam for this proposal.

   - `C-c C-k' will abort taking a note.  You can use this in remember
     buffers and when taking a logging note (e.g. for a state
     change).  Thanks to Bastien.

   - `C-c C-x C-w' and `C-c C-x M-w' now accept a prefix arg to
     cut N sequential subtrees.  This was a proposal by John.

   - Lines in the agenda are now bold if they have priority A and
     italic if they have priority C.  You can turn this off using
     the variable `org-agenda-fontify-priorities'.  Thanks to
     John Wiegley for the idea and code.

   - New variable `org-scheduled-past-days' to set the number a
     scheduled item will be listed after its date has passed.
     Default is 10000, i.e. indefinitely.

   - New variables `org-agenda-deadline-leaders' and
     `org-agenda-scheduled-leaders' to adjust the leading text o
     scheduled items and deadline in the agenda.  Thanks to John
     Wiegley for a patch.

   - New sparse tree function `org-sparse-tree'.  This is now the
     default binding for `C-c /'.  It requires one additional
     keypress to select a command, but in return is provides a
     single interface to all the different sparse tree commands,
     with full completion support.

   - The variable `org-ellipsis' now defaults to the face
     `org-link' because the visibility of the dots is really bad
     and I have found this change very useful indeed.

   - The #+OPTIONS line has a new option "tags" which can be used
     to set `org-export-with-tags'.  Thanks to Wanrong Lin for
     this proposal.

   - New variable `org-use-property-inheritance'.  Configure it
     to `t' if you want that searching for entries with certain
     properties always should assume inheritance.  This is not
     well tested yet, please check it out.

   - Bug fixes

* Version 5.11

** Overview

   - SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION, LOCATION properties for iCalendar
   - Command to jump to the running clock
   - Clock entries can now have their own drawer
   - `C-c C-x C-r' only updates a clocktable at point
   - New way to assign a remember template to a single key
   - `C-n' and `C-p' are back to their default binding
   - `C-x C-s' in agenda buffer saves all org-mode buffers
   - Schedule/deadline leaves note in agenda buffer
   - Prefix argument for `C-c C-d/s' will remove date
   - New variable to make block aranda more compact
   - Better tag alignment in agenda

** Incompatible changes

   - If you have customized `org-drawers', you need to add
     "CLOCK" to the list of drawers.

   - The variable `org-agenda-align-tags-to-column' has been
     renamed to `org-agenda-tags-column'.  The old name is still
     an alias, in Emacs 22 and in XEmacs, but not in Emacs 21.

   - The default value for both `org-tags-column' and
     `org-agenda-tags-column' is now -80.

   - The variable
     `org-insert-labeled-timestamps-before-properties-drawer'
     is now obsolete.

** Details

   - The LOGGING property allows to modify the settings for
     progress logging for a single entry.  For example:

     : :PROPERTIES:
     :   :LOGGING: nologging nologrepeat
     : :END:

     turns off all progress logging for the current entry and its
     children.

   - The properties SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION and LOCATION have
     special meaning during iCalendar export, when they translate
     to the corresponding VEVENT and VTODO fields.  If not given,
     Org-ode continues to use cleaned-up version of the headline
     and body as the summary and the description, respectively.

   - New function to go to the entry with the currently running
     clock.  Bound to `C-c C-x C-j', in agenda also to "J".  If
     you use this often, you might even want to assign a global
     key.  Thanks to Bernt and Bastien.

   - Clock entries can now have their own drawer, the :CLOCK:
     drawer.  Check out the variable `org-clock-into-drawer' for
     configuration of this feature.  The default is to create a
     drawer when the second clocking line gets added to an entry.
     Note that "CLOCK" has been added to the default value of
     `org-drawers', but if you have configured that variable, you
     must go back and add "CLOCK" yourself to get this drawer
     folded away.  Thanks to Tom Weissman for pointing out that
     too many clock entries are visually annoying.

   - `C-c C-x C-r' no longer tries to find the first clocktable
     in a buffer and then updates it.  Instead, it will update
     the clocktable at point if there is one (same as C-c C-c
     will do if the cursor is in the "#+BEGIN" line of the
     table).  If there is none at point, a new one will be
     inserted.  This change was necessary because the new :scope
     parameter allows to have several clocktables in a buffer.
     Thanks to Bastien for pointing this out.
     To update all dynamic blocks in a file, use `C-u C-c C-x C-u'.

   - The function `org-remember' can now be called with a
     template selection key as argument.  This helps to make key
     bindings that go directly to a specific template without
     being prompted for a template, like this:

     : (global-set-key [f5] (lambda () (interactive) (org-remember "j")))

     Thanks to Richard G Riley for bringing this up.

   - `C-n' and `C-p' are back to their default binding
     (next/previous line) in the agenda buffer.  Enough people,
     including recently Denis Bueno, have complained about this,
     and I agree it is not good to break habits like that.

   - `C-x C-s' in an agenda buffer now saves all org-mode buffers
     (also `s' does this).

   - Setting schedule or deadline dates from the agenda now
     produces a note in the agenda, similarly to what happens
     with S-left/right.

   - Using a prefix argument for `C-c C-d' or `C-c C-s' will
     remove the deadline or scheduling date from an item.  Thanks
     to Wanrong Lin for this proposal.

   - New variable `org-agenda-compact-blocks'.  When set, the
     space between blocks in a block agenda is reduced as much as
     possible, to show more items on a single screen.

   - The variable `org-agenda-tags-column' (renamed from
     `org-agenda-align-tags-to-column') can now also be negative,
     to mean alignment to the left.  The new default is -80, just
     like it is now for `org-tags-column'.

   - Bug fixes

* Version 5.10

** Overview

   - Category and the archive location can be properties.
   - The clocktable has a new =:scope= parameter.
   - CSV support when importing a table.
   - Better defaults when modifying a time stamp.
   - New way to specify the duration of an appointment.
   - More aggressive version of orgstruct-mode improved wrapping.
   - Modifications to priority cycling.
   - Modifications to computations in column view.
   - New command `org-occur-in-agenda-files'.
   - Bug fixes.

** Details

   - Both the category and the archive location in a (sub)tree of
     the buffer can now be specified using a property, for
     example:

     : * Tree with special properties
     :   :PROPERTIES:
     :     :CATEGORY: Examples
     :     :ARCHIVE:  /some/special/file::
     :   :END:

     This is a much cleaner way of dealing with multiple
     categories and archives in a single file.  The preferred use
     of the =#+CATEGORY= and =#+ARCHIVE= lines is now to set a
     *single* default for the file which is then locally
     overruled by properties.  This was a proposal from Bastien
     if I remember correctly.  Multiple =#+= lines still work
     and I don't plan to remove this support soon, but I
     encourage you to stop using them.

   - The clocktable has a new =:scope= parameter that determines
     the range in the file from which clock entries should be
     taken.  This can be anything from the local subtree to the
     entire buffer to even the full list of agenda files.  Legal
     values are:

     | value   | scope                                           |
     |---------+-------------------------------------------------|
     | nil     | the current buffer or narrowed region           |
     | file    | the full current buffer                         |
     | subtree | the subtree where the clocktable is located     |
     | treeN   | the surrounding level N tree, for example tree3 |
     | tree    | the surrounding level 1 tree                    |
     | agenda  | all agenda files                                |

     Thanks to Jason F. McBrayer and Bernt Hansen for
     inspiration.  Thanks to cranreuch (what is you full name?)
     for mentioning, at the right moment, that the clocktable is
     not so bad - that remark made it seem worthwhile to add
     features.

   - The commands to import a table and to convert a region to a
     table can now handle comma-separated values (CSV).  The
     algorithm does not yet treat quoting correctly, but for
     basic input it works.

   - When modifying an existing time stamp, or when entering the
     second stamp of a range, the date prompt will now
     consistently default to the date/time in the existing stamp.
     This was triggered by Nuutti Kotivuori's request.

   - At the date/time prompt, there is a new way to specify a
     range of hours, by using "+DURATION" after the time.  For
     example:

     :  14:00+2  means 14:00-16:00
     :  2pm+2:30 means 14:00-16:30

     Again, Nuutti Kotivuori's request.

   - When you use the function `turn-on-orgstruct++' to turn on
     orgstruct-mode, the special org-mode settings for
     auto-filling, indentation and paragraphs are exported into
     the buffer, so that typing list items with indentation works
     better.  This was Bastien's idea and request.

   - New variable `org-priority-start-cycle-with-default'.  When
     t (the default), priority cycling will initially set the
     default priority and then increase or decrease.  When nil,
     the first priority set by cycling is already 1 different
     from the default priority.  This was mostly driven by
     Bastien.

   - In column view: When an entry has a property for a summary
     column defined, its value is normally overwritten by the sum
     of all the children's values each time you enter column
     view.  Now there is an exception to this rule: If none of
     the children has that particular property defined, the
     parent's value stays.  In this way you can still place TODO
     items under such an entry without getting the property value
     changed.  Thanks to Russel Adams for pointing out that this
     is a better way of doing things.

   - In column view, computed values are now bold face, and
     trying to edit them is an error.  I think this works, but
     testing is appreciated.

   - New command `org-occur-in-agenda-files', this is basically
     the quick command John Wiegley proposed the other day, but
     it also works when the agenda files are not yet in buffers.
     The key is `C-c C-x /', any better proposals?

   - Links containing a space will now be handled correctly when
     calling the browser.  Note that you need to enclose such
     links in square or angular brackets.

   - Bug fixes.

* Version 5.09

** Overview

   - Taking a note upon TODO state changes can be restricted to
     selected states.

   - The format in which dates are shown in the daily/weekly
     agenda can be configured.

   - The default for `org-remember-store-without-prompt' is now t.

   - `org-goto' has been made into a general lookup command.

   - Priority cycling goes back to the nil state.

   - You can store a remember note to the *last used* location.

   - On Emacs 23, the headline faces for org-mode are now
     inherited from the outline faces.

** Incompatible Changes

   - The default for `org-remember-store-without-prompt' is now
     t, in order to better match the original intent of
     remember.el (storing a note with minimum interruption of
     work flow).  I expect that many people will be hit by this
     incompatible change - nevertheless I believe it is the right
     thing to do.

** Details

   - You can now select specific states for recording a note when
     switching to that state.  With the setting

     : #+SEQ_TODO: TODO(t) ORDERED(o@) INVOICE(i@) PAYED(p) | RECEIVED(r)
     : #+STARTUP: lognotestate

     only the states ORDERED and INVOICE will record a timestamp
     and a note.

   - You can now set the format of the string for each day in the
     agenda and timeline buffers.  You can use a format string
     interpreted by `format-time-string', or you can write your
     own function.  Configure the new variable
     `org-agenda-format-date'.  Thanks to Levin for triggering
     this development with a patch.

   - The default for `org-remember-store-without-prompt' is now
     t, in order to better match the original intent of
     remember.el (storing a note with minimum interruption of
     work flow).  Since we can assign files and headlines to
     templates, I guess this takes care of selecting a filing
     location in most cases.  For interactive filing, you now
     need a prefix command when exiting `remember'.

   - `org-goto' (bound to `C-c C-j') now uses an indirect buffer
     and has additional commands enabled: Org-occur with `C-c /'
     or even faster with `/', and the commands needed to select
     and copy a region.  This make `org-goto' a more general
     lookup command instead of only a jumping command.  Remember
     that you can exit with `Q' to go back to the original
     location.  Thanks to William Henney for this idea.

   - Setting the priority with S-up/down now cycles back to a
     state where no priority is specified.  This was requested by
     Rick Moynihan.

   - You can store a remember note to the *last used* location.
     So if you select a location interactively once, you can
     re-use it without having to find it again.  For this, exit
     the remember buffer with `C-u C-u C-c C-c'.  The leading
     comment in the remember buffer will tell exactly where the
     note goes if you exit with a particular command.
     Thanks to Maxim Loginov for this idea.

   - On Emacs 23, the headline faces for org-mode are now
     inherited from the outline faces.  This is just a
     convenience, so that you only have to configure one set of
     faces, and that will then be outline-1 .. outline-8.  You
     will actually not see any difference in org-mode, because
     Stefan Monnier has made the outline faces in Emacs 23 to
     match the current org-mode faces.

     This change does not effect XEmacs, nor Emacs 21 and 22.

* Version 5.08

** Incompatible changes

   - The default for `org-deadline-warning-days' is now 14.

** Details

   - There is now a separate interface for fast and directly
     setting a TODO keyword.  This interface kicks in when you
     have configured keys for TODO keywords like

     : #+SEQ_TODO: TODO(t) WAITING(w) | DONE(d) CANCELED(c)

     C-c C-t still does the cycling thing, you need to use a
     prefix argument to get to the fast interface.  Or configure
     the variable `org-use-fast-todo-selection' to t, then this
     will be the default and the prefix argument will make the
     command fall back to cycling.

     The tag selection no longer does include TODO keywords -
     Leo's arguments have convinced me that this is not a good
     idea.  If you'd like to see the TODO keywords in the tags
     interface anyway, set the variable
     `org-fast-tag-selection-include-todo'.  Thanks to Leo and
     others for input on this issue.

   - New variable `org-edit-timestamp-down-means-later'.  When
     set, `S-down' on a timestamp will change the timestamp to
     later.  Thanks to Raman for this idea.

   - Property names can now contain non-ascii word characters.
     This follows a request from Daniel Clemente.

   - For export, the date that should be given in the exported
     file can now be set to a specific value with a line like

     : #+DATE: 15 November 2003

     If you want to use the date/time when the file was created,
     use a format string that will be interpreted by
     `format-time-string', for example:

     : #+DATE: %Y/%m/%d %X

   - The default of `org-deadline-warning-days' has changed to 14
     days.  30 was really too much, I suspect most people (me
     included) have changed this.

   - When a deadline has an individual lead time, this lead time
     obviously overrules `org-deadline-warning-days'.  However,
     if you bind `org-deadline-warning-days' to a number <=0, for
     example during a custom agenda command, then the absolute
     value of this number will be enforced also when a different
     lead time has been specified.  This is useful to get a list
     of all deadlines coming up in the next N days.

* Version 5.07

** Overview

   - Different faces for different TODO keywords.

   - Setting TODO states through the TAG setting interface.

   - Context information is stored when moving a tree to the archive.

   - Sorting can be done by priority.

   - `Org-ellipsis' can now also be a face.

   - Scheduling info is no longer removed entry is marked CLOSED.

   - Unavailable files in `org-agenda-files' can be skipped.

** Incompatible changes

   - The time of archiving is now stored as a property.
     ARCHIVED is no longer a special time keyword.

   - Scheduling info is no longer removed entry is marked CLOSED.

** Details

   - You can now define different faces for different TODO
     keywords.  This request has come up frequently, so here it
     is: Use the variable `org-todo-keyword-faces'.

     A Here is a configuration example:

     : (setq org-todo-keyword-faces
     :   '(("TODO"      . org-warning)
     :     ("DEFERRED"  . shadow)
     :     ("CANCELED"  . (:foreground "blue" :weight bold
     :                    :underline t))))

     Org-mode continue still use `org-todo' and `org-done' for
     keywords that have no specific face assigned.

   - Some People use TODO states more like tags.  For them the
     TODO keywords mark special states and they like to quickly
     switch between states in arbitrary sequence.  The standard
     TODO interface is not perfect for this, because it assumes
     that the states are reached in sequence.  However, the fast
     tag setting interface is in fact perfect for this.  You can
     now "misuse" the TAG selection interface to also set TODO
     states.  All you need to do is to assign keys to the TODO
     states, just like you also do for tags.

     : #+SEQ_TODO: TODO(t) WAITING(w) | CANCELED(c) DONE(d)
     : #+TAGS: @HOME(h) @OFFICE(o) @SHOP(s)

     Next time you try to set tags with C-c C-c, the todo states
     will be offered as well, and the corresponding key will
     switch the entry to that state.

   - New variable `org-archive-save-context-info' governs if
     information that would be lost by moving a subtree to the
     archive file, should be stored as special properties.  For
     example,

     : (setq org-archive-save-context-info '(itags category))

     will store the inherited tags and the category in properties
     ARCHIVE_ITAGS and ARCHIVE_CATEGORY, respectively.  The
     default setting for this variable is to save everything that
     could be lost.  This was a proposal by John Wiegley.

   - Sorting (`C-c ^') can use the use the priority to sort.  Use
     the "p" and "P" keys at the prompt.  John Wiegley, again.

   - `Org-ellipsis' can now also be a face to make the folding
     ellipsis more visible.  This is based on a post by Tassilo
     Horn.  Since `org-ellipsis' only works in Org-mode, you
     might want to use Tassilo Horn's hack directly in order to
     affect the folding ellipsis globally.

   - Scheduling info is no longer removed when an entry is marked
     CLOSED.  This was a request by Brian van den Broek.  Let me
     know if this breaks anything for you - then it will become
     an option.

   - New option `org-agenda-skip-unavailable-files'.  Currently,
     if a file does not exist, it will be removed from
     `org-agenda-files' after a query.  When this option is set,
     the file will simply be skipped.

   - Bug fixes.

* Version 5.06

** Overview

** Details

   - When exporting only a region and this region is a single
     (sub)tree (for example selected with `C-c @'), the title for
     the exported document is taken to be the heading of the
     subtree.  The sublevels become top-level entries in the
     export.  Furthermore, if the head entry of the tree has or
     inherits an EXPORT_FILE_NAME property, that file name (with
     appropriately substituted extension) will be used for the
     exported tree.  Thanks to Patrick Drechsler and Jost Burkart
     for these ideas.

   - org-special-ctrl-a/e has a third allowed value, `reversed'.
     When it is set to this value, the first C-a or C-e command
     behaves normally, i.e. it goes to the true beginning or end
     of the line.  Only when you press C-a or C-e immediately
     again, the the "special" position will be found.  Additional
     presses of the same key jump between the two positions.  I
     like this a lot better than the `t' setting, because now the
     keys behave more predictable and still give easy access to
     the special locations.

   - New command to set or remove a tag from all headlines in a
     region.

   - When Org-mode visits a file, it will initially hide all
     drawers.

   - The default of the variable `org-cycle-global-at-bob' is now
     nil, meaning that TAB no longer does global visibility
     cycling at the beginning of the buffer.

   - Bug fixes, in particular the problems with scheduling and
     deadlines introduced in 5.05.  Please check carefully if
     this works correctly again, and complain if not.

* Version 5.05

** Overview

   - LaTeX export, finally, thanks to Bastien.

   - Extension mechanism for the hyperlink system.

   - Global access to commands inserting and following links.

   - Individual lead-times for deadlines.

   - Option to show only the next instance of repeating timestamp.

   - Store remember notes with only 2 keys: C-c C-c

   - Appointment reminders from Org-mode.

   - Global values for selected properties.

   - Bug fixes.


** Details

   - Bastien's `org-export-latex.el' is now part of the org-mode
     distribution.  You can export an Org-mode document to a
     LaTeX file with `C-c C-e l'.  For more options, see the
     manual, and the commentary in the Lisp file.  Kudos to
     Bastien for contributing this frequently requested feature.
     I am sure this has been tough because of the many different
     ways I have been allowing LaTeX snippets and environments to
     be incorporated in lazy free-format ways.

   - Org-mode has now an extension mechanism for the hyperlink
     system.  This should clear the road for all those mairix and
     other ideas that have been floating around.  Now it is on
     *you* to write and share new link types for Org-mode.  The
     interface for adding a new link type is described in the
     appendix of the manual, section A2.  The unsolved problem is
     currently how to handle the new link types for
     export/publishing.

   - New *global* commands `org-open-at-point-global' and
     `org-insert-link-global'.  You can bind these commands to
     global keys and use them to insert and follow Org-mode-like
     links anywhere in Emacs.  Thanks to Adam Spiers for this
     excellent idea.

   - Each deadline timestamp may now specify its own interval of
     lead-time display, given in days, weeks, months or years.
     The syntax is like this

     : DEADLINE: <2007-08-13 Mon -5d>

     When combined with a repeater, the repeater has to come
     first:

     : DEADLINE: <2007-08-13 Mon +2w -5d>

     You may now also customize the faces that are used in the
     agenda to indicate the distance of an approaching deadline.
     See the new option `org-agenda-deadline-faces'.

     Thanks to Pavel Chalmoviansky and John Wiegley proposals in
     this direction.

   - New option `org-agenda-repeating-timestamp-show-all'.  When
     set to nil, repeating time stamps will only show up once in
     the agenda, either today or in the near future.  Other
     matches will be ignored.  Thanks to John Wiegley for this
     proposal.

   - New variable `org-remember-store-without-prompt'.  When set,
     exiting the remember buffer with C-c C-c will store the note
     without further prompts to the default location, and `C-u
     C-c C-c' will get the prompts for file and location.  So
     this variable reverses the prefix-argument functionality for
     storing remember notes.  This follows a request from John
     Wiegley.

   - A new function `org-agenda-to-appt' activates all
     appointments for the current day so that Emacs will display
     reminders.  This uses appt.el.  Thanks to Bastien for this
     function.

   - You can now set default values for properties that can be
     inherited by all entries in a buffer, or by all entries
     globally.  Global properties are set in the variable
     `org-global-properties', like this:

       (setq org-global-properties '(("NAME" "This is the value")))

     Buffer-local values are set like this:

       #+PROPERTY: NAME This is the value

     When using org-entry-get to get the value of a property with
     the `inherit' flag and the hierarchy above the entry does
     not contain this property, the buffer-local and global lists
     are checked as well.  This is mostly useful (I think) to set
     the list of allowed values for a property.  Thanks to Bernt
     Hansen and Bastien for these ideas.

   - Bug fixes.

* Version 5.04

** Details

   - New variables `org-export-author-info' and
     `org-export-time-stamp-file' to turn off inclusion of author
     and time information into exported files.  Thank to Patrick
     Drechsler for pointing out that this would be useful.

   - New variable to avoid moving DEADLINE and SCHEDULED info
     into the property drawer.  The default is now to not move
     this stuff into the drawer.
     `org-insert-labeled-timestamps-before-properties-drawer'

   - `org-archive-mark-done' can be a string now, to select a
     specific keyword that should be used for archived entries.

   - New command "j" in agenda to jump to an arbitrary date.
     Thanks to Bernt Hansen for the patch.

   - Lots of minor fixes.

* Version 5.03

** Incompatible Changes

   - The variable `org-special-ctrl-a' has been renamed to
     `org-special-ctrl-a/e'.  The old one is still an alias (but
     not on Emacs 21 where variable aliases cannot be defined).

** Details

  - When the variable `org-special-ctrl-a/e' is set, C-e in a
    headline first goes to the end of the headline ignoring the
    tags.  A second C-e then goes to after the tags.

  - Typing and removing single characters in a headline now
    keeps the tags in the headline aligned.  This could have a
    little impact on performance while deleting stuff - let me
    know if we need to make this customizable.

  - New option `org-n-level-faces' can be used to set the number
    of different faces that are used for headlines.  Default is
    all 8 faces Org-mode defines for this purpose, level 9 uses
    again the level-1 face.  However, you can use fewer, and then
    the level-1 face will be reused already for level N+1, etc.

  - Column View and hidestars now work together.

  - Bug fixes.


* Version 5.02

** Overview

   - The interfaces for properties and column view are finished
     now and work well.

   - Properties can be summaries, i.e. the parent nodes can
     compute their value from the children's values.

   - Headlines finally require a space ofter the star(s).  The
     conflict with bold text at the beginning of the line is no
     longer there.

** Incompatible Changes

   - Bad news.  It looks like it is going to be really hard to
     make column view work on XEmacs and on Emacs 21.  Emacs 22
     is currently the only Emacs where this works.  If you are
     using Emacs 21 or XEmacs, you can still use properties, but
     not column view.

** Details

   - Improvements for properties:

     + There are interactive commands to insert and delete
       properties.  Read the manual chapter 7 for details.

     + You can define /allowed values/ for a property.  When
       these are defined, you can change the value of a property
       with S-left and S-right.  And you may use completion when
       inserting the property.  This goes a long way to prevent
       typos when entering properties.

   - Improvements for column view.

     + In column view, you may use the keys S-left/right (and
       also the keys `n' and `p') to switch from one allowed
       value to the next.

     + You can define summaries for columns.  For example,
       parents can contain the sum of all children values of a
       property, or the parent node can have a check box property
       that is automatically checked when all children's boxes are
       checked.

     + There are interactive commands to add and remove columns,
       and to change the attributes of a column like the summary
       type.

     These additions lead to the exciting fact that the example
     from [[http://www.omnigroup.com/images/applications/omnioutliner/features/multicolumn.jpg][omni outliner]] posted by Scott Jaderholm can now be
     accurately [[file:omni-org.jpg][reproduced by Org-mode]].

   - The space after the stars is now required in a headline, in
     order to remove the conflict with bold words at the
     beginning of a line.  So

     :    * This is a level 1 headline
     :    *this is bold text*

   - S-up and S-down to navigate plain item lists are now also
     available in orgstruct-mode.

* Version 5.01

** Overview

   - A new minor mode, orgstruct-mode, exports the Org-mode
     structure editing commands into any other mode.

   - DRAWERS are a new level off folding for special sections
     that should stay closed during visibility cycling and only
     open if explicitly asked.

   - Entries can now have PROPERTIES.

   - A COLUMN VIEW implementation allows to easily view and edit
     the properties of a hierarchy of entries (Emacs only, for
     now).

   - Formula evaluation in the spreadsheet is more consistent
     now.  Properties and per-file constants can be used during
     evaluation.

   - Bug fixes and minor changes.

** Incompatible changes

   - When using LEVEL=N in a tags search, things have changed if
     you are also using `org-odd-levels-only'.  If you are using
     only odd levels (i.e. 1 or 3 or 5... stars), LEVEL=2 will
     now refer to 3 stars, LEVEL=3 to 5 stars etc.  Many thanks
     to Leo (or blame on him if you must) who has convinced me
     that this is the better convention.

** Details

*** Orgstruct minor mode

    There is a new minor mode, orgstruct-mode.  This modes works
    in a similar way as Orgtbl-mode.  It can be used to export
    the Org-mode structure-editing commands into arbitrary major
    modes in Emacs.  For example, you can use it in Mail-mode to
    easily create lists.

    The functionality in Orgstruct mode is only active, if the
    cursor is in a line that looks either like a headline, or
    like the first line of a plain list item.  Then the commands
    `TAB', `M-cursor', `M-S-cursor', `M-RET', `M-S-RET', `C-c ^',
    `C-c C-c', and `C-c -' will do structure-related editing just
    like in Org-mode.  If the cursor is not in such a line, all
    these keys will do whatever the major mode or other active
    minor modes have assigned to them.

    Orgstruct-mode is the result of a proposal by Raman, quite
    some time ago.  It has taken a long time, but here is finally
    the promised implementation.

*** Drawers

    The new concept of /drawers/ allows to create sections
    that remain folded during visibility cycling.  Drawers need
    to be configured using the variable `org-drawers'.  A drawer
    starts with a line containing only the name of the drawer
    bracketed by colons. It ends with :END:.  For example,
    after setting

    :   (setq org-drawers '("PROPERTIES" "HIDDEN"))

    you can then create drawers like this:

    :   :HIDDEN:
    :     here is some stuff that remains hidden
    :     unless TAB is pressed directly in that line
    :   :END:

    The PROPERTIES drawer has special meaning for ORG-mode, it
    contains properties of an entry (see below).

*** Properties and Column View

    - Entries in Org-mode can now have arbitrary /properties/
      associated with them.  Org-mode handles some default
      properties like the TODO state, the priority, the local
      tags, and planning information like DEADLINE and SCHEDULED.
      In addition, you can assign arbitrary properties by creating
      a property drawer and inserting a line like

      :   :PROPNAME: This is the value of the property

      Org-mode has an API for properties, if you want to write a
      program using properties, use the functions
      `org-entry-properties', `org-entry-get', `org-entry-put',
      and `org-entry-delete'.

    - Planning information like DEADLINE can be hidden in the
      properties drawer.

      If the PROPERTIES drawer starts in the first line after a
      headline, also the DEADLINE, SCHEDULED and CLOCK information
      will be inserted inside the drawer.  If no PROPERTIES drawer
      is present, or if it does not start in the line right after
      the headline, this information remains in the lines directly
      after the headline, outside the drawer.

    - TAGS searches can now also query properties.  For example,
      the search

      :   LEVEL=3+BOSS+ASSIGNED="Hans"/WAITING

      will find entries that
      - are level 3
      - have the tag BOSS
      - have an ASSIGNED property with the value "Hans"
      - are TODO status WAITING.

	So here is an entry that will match:

	:   *** WAITING Clean up the factory     :BOSS:
	:       :PROPERTIES:
	:       :ASSIGNED: Hans
	:       :END:

	You may also use a regular expression to match against a
	property value.  For example, to find stuff assigned to Hans
	or Sarah, use

	:   ASSIGNED={^\(Hans\|Sarah\)$}

    - Column View is a special way to look at property values in
      tabular form.  Column View can be used in any org-mode
      file, and also in any agenda buffer.  It works by placing
      an overlay over each headline (or agenda line) that shows a
      table of selected properties.  You can look at and edit
      properties from this view.  Which properties are shown in
      the table must be set up using the COLUMNS property.  You
      can set up different property columns on different levels
      of an outline tree.  For example:

      :   * People
      :     :PROPERTIES:
      :     :COLUMNS: %25ITEM %Name
      :     :END:
      :   ** Family
      :      :PROPERTIES:
      :      :COLUMNS: %25ITEM %Name %3Age
      :      :END:
      :   *** Sam
      :       Info about Sam, including a property list with Name and Age.
      :   *** Sarah
      :       Info about Sarah, including a property list with Name and Age.
      :   ** Office
      :      :PROPERTIES:
      :      :COLUMNS: %25ITEM %Name %Function %Salary
      :      :END:
      :   *** Boss
      :       Info about the Boss, including a property list with Name,
      :       Function and Salary (if only we knew....).

      Now we have defined three different sets of columns.  If
      you switch to column view in the /Family/ section, you
      will get a different table than if you do it in the
      /Office/ section.  However, if you switch to column
      view with the cursor on the /People/ section, the
      table will cover all entries, but contain only the
      /Name/.

      Column view does, for the time being, only work on Emacs.
      The XEmacs implementation needs a bit of work.

    - Properties can be used in table formulas.  To access the
      value of the property :XYZ:, use $PROP_XYZ.  The property
      needs to be defined in the hierarchy above the table, not
      necessarily in the same entry as the table.  This was a
      request by Eddward.  File-wide constants can be defined with
      #+CONSTANTS, see below.

    - Things that still need to be sorted out about drawers,
      properties and column view - comments and suggestions
      welcome!

      + How to deal with drawers and properties in HTML and ASCII
	export?
      + What key could be used to insert an empty property drawer
	into an entry?
      + Right now column view is invoked through the command C-c
	C-x C-c.  It is too easy to type C-x C-c by mistake, and
	that causes Emacs to quit.  Suggestions for a different
	key?
      + Fontification of drawers and properties is not good yet.
	Any suggestions for better defaults?
      + Mouse support for editing properties in column view would
	be nice - maybe Piotr is interested to add this to
	org-mouse.el?

*** Spreadsheet

    - In the spreadsheet, the evaluation of formulas has changed.
      Previously, first the column formulas would be evaluated
      everywhere, and then the field formulas would kick in, and
      in some cases overwrite the results of column formulas in
      the appropriate fields.  This had the side effect that some
      formulas might always use the wrong, intermediate content of
      a field that is computed both by a column and a field
      formula.

      From now on, column formulas will no longer temporarily
      overwrite field formulas.  This gives much more consistent
      results.  For example you can now finally have a column of
      increasing numbers by setting the first field to a fixed
      number, and let the rest follow from a column formula.

      Here is an example

      :   | 1 |
      :   | 2 |
      :   | 3 |
      :   #+TBLFM: $1=@-1+1::@1$1=1

    - Constants for formulas in spreadsheets are globally defined
      with the variable `org-table-formula-constants'.  File-local
      constants can now be set with a line like:

      :   #+CONSTANTS: c=299792458.  pi=3.14  eps=2.4e-6

*** Minor changes

    - When entries are archived, a timestamp for the moment of
      archiving is added to the line with planning information.
      It looks like this:

      : ARCHIVED: [2007-07-02 Mon 11:34]

      Thanks to J. David Boyd for constructive comments.

    - Bug fixes

      Many bugs are fixed, as usually all the ones where I replied
      "fixed" on emacs-orgmode.  If you reported one of these
      bugs, please check if it really has disappeared in the new
      version, and complain if not.  Thanks!


* Version 4.79

** Details

   - We are back to a single file org.el that works both on Emacs
     and on XEmacs.  Merging comes at a speed penalty for you as
     an XEmacs user, but *only if you do not compile* org.el.
     Compilation completely removes the penalty.

   - New L flag for literal interpolation in Lisp formulas.
     See manual section 3.5.3.

   - New options for turning off footnotes.
     This was a request from Ignotus.
     See the option `org-export-with-footnotes'.

   - Default length for Agenda entries, but this is off by
     default.  This was a request from Micheal.
     See the option `org-agenda-default-appointment-duration'.

   - Bug fixes:

     + org-agenda-date-later (Juraj Kubelka)
     + letters off margin in orgcard.ps (Charles Cave)
     + TODO export problems on XEmacs (ignotus@freemail.hu)
     + args-out-of-range with table formulas (Cecil Westerhof)
     + problem with org-file without a heading (Tim O'Callaghan)

* Version 4.78

** Overview

   - Time stamps with a time range *included*, like
     : <2007-06-18 Mon 17:33-18:23>

   - Clock times without clocking in/out: CLOCK: => 2:00

   - Language-specific characters allowed in TAGS (Emacs only).

   - Promotion and demotion of items gets the indentation right.

   - Indenting lines with TAB is more intelligent.

** Incompatible changes

   - There is now a special version of `org.el' for XEmacs.
     Before installation, as an XEmacs user you must rename the
     file org_xemacs.el to org.el, i.e. you must overwrite org.el
     with the xemacs version.  For example:

     : mv org_xemacs.el org.el

     This is necessary so that I can make use of some features
     that would be cumbersome to support in a single file.  The
     XEmacs version is derived from the Emacs version with a
     program, so no reason to fear that I might be dropping
     XEmacs support any time soon.  Sorry for the trouble.

** Details

   - A time stamp may now contain a range of times.  So you no
     longer need to use two separate stamps to indicate a time
     interval on a single day.  For example

     : <2007-06-18 Mon 17:30-18:20>

     This is now fully supported, including changing the time
     with S-up/down while the cursor is on the end time.  Also,
     da the date/time prompt, you can simply write your time like
     12:00-14:00 and the range will be inserted.

     This was proposed by Leo some time ago, and recently by
     Michael.

   - You may specify clocking times by hand (i.e. without
     clocking in and out) using this syntax.

     : CLOCK: => 2:00

     Thanks to Scott Jaderholm for this proposal.

   - TAGS may now contain language-specific word characters, as
     long as they are matched by the "[:alnum:]" regexp syntax.
     This is for Emacs only, the XEmacs version continues to use
     the character class "a-zA-Z0-9_@" for tag names.  Thanks to
     David Smith for a patch to this effect (a modified version
     of that patch was applied).  I am considering to make the
     same change for TODO keywords, but not yet.  Note that files
     using localization features may not work correctly in the
     Emacs configuration of another user, so if you are sharing
     org-mode files with other users, it might still be best to
     stick to the ASCII characters.

   - Promotion and demotion of plain list items (commands M-left,
     M-right) no longer changes the indentation by just one
     space.  Instead, it uses intelligence gathered from the
     surrounding list structure to do the right thing.  Thanks to
     William Henney for starting the discussion about this.

   - TAB does now a better job of indenting lines.

     + After tables and code segments (lines starting with ":"),
       indentation goes back to what it was before (thanks to
       William Henney for suggesting this behavior).

     + When plain lists items are involved, we had a long
       discussion on emacs-orgmode where I tried to show that a
       too-sophisticated implementation will still be easily
       fooled.   Here is what I have implemented now - lets see
       if we can agree on this:

       Indentation will flatten lists with the same bullet type,
       but indent another bullet type further.  The time when
       this fails is in a nested list, when you want to get back
       out to a previous level.  For example

       : - item 1
       : - item 2
       : + item 2a
       : + item 2b
       : - item 3

       When using TAB on every line in this list, the structure
       will change to

       : - item 1
       : - item 2
       :   + item 2a
       :   + item 2b
       :     - item 3

       So you need to change the level of the last line by hand,
       using promotion and demotion functions.

* Version 4.77

** Overview

   - Vertical lines in exported tables.
   - New default for `org-show-following-heading'.

** Incompatible changes

   - The default for `org-show-following-heading' is now nil.

** Details

   - You can now specify column groups in tables, to the effect
     that the groups will be separated by vertical lines in HTML
     and ASCII output.  Column groups are specified by the
     characters "<" and ">" in a special table row.  "<" starts a
     group, ">" ends a group (in each case including the the
     column where the character is specified).  You may also use
     "<>" to make a group a single column wide.  For example:

: |   |  N | N^2 | N^3 | N^4 | sqrt(n) | sqrt[4](N) |
: |---+----+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
: | / | <> |   < |     |   > |       < |          > |
: | # |  1 |   1 |   1 |   1 |       1 |          1 |
: | # |  2 |   4 |   8 |  16 |  1.4142 |     1.1892 |
: | # |  3 |   9 |  27 |  81 |  1.7321 |     1.3161 |
: #+TBLFM: $3=$2^2::$4=$2^3::$5=$2^4::$6=sqrt($2)::$7=sqrt(sqrt(($2))

     A table row with with nothing but "/" in the first field is
     never exported, but can be used to place column group
     information into the table.  In this table, we create a
     group for column 2, one for columns 3-5 and one for columns
     6-7.  HTML export will render a vertical line between these
     groups.

     Because HTML does not require closing <colgroup> tags with
     </colgroup>), you can also simply start a new column
     wherever you want a vertical line:

: | N | N^2 | N^3 | N^4 | sqrt(n) | sqrt[4](N0 |
: |---+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
: | / | <   | <   |     | <       |            |

   - Vertical lines are now also omitted in ASCII export, unless
     grouping explicitly requests these lines.

   - The default for `org-show-following-heading' is now nil,
     meaning that sparse trees will be more compact.  This has
     become possible due to in important remark by Jason Dunsmore
     who pointed out that TAB should behave differently in the
     inconsistent trees produced by the sparse tree commands.
     TAB does now make sure that the heading after a freshly
     unfolded tree is made visible at all, removing the confusing
     behavior we had before.

   - Several bugs fixed.  In particular:

     + Strings produced by agenda batch processing with
       `org-batch-agenda' and `org-batch-agenda-csv' are now
       properly encoded, so that you should be able to use
       special characters in other languages as along as your
       post-processing program handles them correctly.  At least
       for Emacs this should work now, but have not yet figured
       out how to do this in XEmacs.

* Version 4.76

** Overview

   - Exporting Footnotes to HTML

** Details

   - Footnotes like[1] are now exported to HTML

        [1]This is a footnote

     Thanks to Scott Jaderholm for this proposal and a detailed
     HTML example on how the exported text should look like.

   - Special version of the reference card, for letter paper.

   - Switching to OVERVIEW with S-TAB no loner moves the cursor,
     so after three `S-TAB' commands, you will be back where you
     started.

   - Bug fixes, lots of them again.

* Version 4.75

** Overview

   - Cyclic time stamps that repeat after an interval.
   - Special timestamps for appointments like "every 2nd Thursday
     in a month".
   - Completion of link abbreviation prefixes inside `C-c C-l'.
   - Replacing a region of org-mode syntax with HTML.
   - iCalendar export now honors ARCHIVE etc.
   - New command to add/change emphasis markers.

** Incompatible Changes

   - The REPEAT(...) cookie is no longer supported, the repeater
     interval now goes directly into the time stamp.

** Details

   - Time stamps can contain a repeater code, like +1w for once
     every week, +2d for every two days, etc.  For example,

          <2007-05-16 Wed 12:30 +1w>

     will apply to every Wednesday, starting from the date given.
     I believe this syntax was actually suggested by someone on
     the mailing list, but I cannot find the email back.  To
     collect your credit, let me know!

   - You can use an sexp diary entry (with the syntax used by the
     Emacs calendar/diary) in a time stamp, like this:

       *** The nerd club meets on 2nd Thursday of every month
           <%%(diary-float t 4 2)>

   - You can put diary-style sexp entries directly into an
     org-mode file, where they will be interpreted just like they
     would in the diary.  For example

       * Birthdays and similar stuff
       #+CATEGORY: Holiday
       %%(org-calendar-holiday) ; special function for holiday names
       #+CATEGORY: Ann
       %%(diary-anniversary 14  5 1956) Artur Dent %d is years old
       %%(diary-anniversary  2 10 1869) Mahatma Gandhi

     These entries must start at column 0 to be evaluated.

     It turns out that evaluating the entries in an org-mode file
     is actually faster than in the diary itself, because using
     the diary has some overhead (creating fancy diary display,
     then reading and re-interpreting the entries).  I have moved
     all the sexp entries from my diary into an org-mode file,
     put in a few categories, and then turned off
     `org-agenda-include-diary'.  This has led to a noticeably
     faster agenda display.

   - New command `org-replace-region-by-html' that converts the
     current region from org-mode syntax into HTML.  For example,
     you might write an itemized list in plain text in an HTML
     buffer, and then invoke this command to convert it.  Thanks
     to Raman for this idea.

   - When inserting a link with `C-c C-l', completion will now
     fill in all valid link prefixes, like http or ftp, but also
     link abbreviation prefixes.  This is based on an idea by
     Bastien.

   - Highest, lowest, and default priority can be set on a
     per-file basis with #+PRIORITIES: H L D
     For example, to use priorities from 1 to 9, you could use

       #+PRIORITIES: 1 9 9

     Thanks to Dmitri Minaev for a patch to this effect.

   - iCalendar export now honors (i.e. skips) subtrees marked as
     ARCHIVE, COMMENT, or QUOTE.

   - There is a new command to add or change the emphasis (like
     bold or italic) of a piece of text.  For lack of better
     available keys the command is at `C-c C-x C-f', but you may
     well want to choose a more convenient key like `C-c f' in
     your private setup:

     (add-hook 'org-load-hook
      (lambda () (define-key org-mode-map "\C-cf" 'org-emphasize)))

     The command will prompt for an emphasis type, and you may
     reply either with the marker that triggers the emphasis, or
     with the first letter of the corresponding HTML tag.  For
     example, to select italic, press either "/" or "i".

     If there is an active region, the emphasis of this region
     will be set or changed.  If there is no region, only the
     emphasis markers will be inserted and the cursor positioned
     between them.  Thanks to Bastien for proposing this feature.

   - Bug fixes, everything where I have replied "fixed" on the
     mailing list.  Thanks to all of you for keeping these reports
     coming.

* Version 4.74

** Overview

   This release is about exporting agenda views, to HTML, to
   postscript for printing, and to a special format (CSV) for
   further processing in scripts.

** Incompatible Changes

   - The variable `org-agenda-remove-tags-when-in-prefix' has
     been renamed to `org-agenda-remove-tags'.

** Details

   - Agenda views can be exported as plain text, as HTML, and as
     Postscript(R).  This can simply be done from the agenda
     buffer with `C-x C-w' and then specifying a filename like
     `myagenda.html' or `myagenda.ps'.  See section 8.6.4 of the
     manual.

   - Each custom agenda view can specify a list of associated
     files names.  The command `C-c a e' then creates all views
     that have associated file names and exports the views to
     these files.  This is great for producing paper versions of
     your views, to take with you when you don't have your
     computer.  The manual has an example on how to do this, and
     in particular on how to customize the format of the printed
     version.  See section 8.6.4 of the manual.

   - You can produce a CSV format of agenda information with an
     Emacs batch command.  This is greate for further processing
     in scipts.  Thanks to Jason F. McBrayer for this idea.
     See section 8.6.5 of the manual.

   - New variable `org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done'.  When set,
     a deadline associated with a DONE item will not be shown in
     the agenda.  This is based upon a report by Denis Bueno.

   - Quite a few bug fixes.

* Version 4.73

  Minor bug fixes.

* Version 4.72

** Overview

   - Control over blank lines between trees in collapsed view.

   - Info about the running clock is shown in the modeline.

   - C-a can behave specially in headlines.

   - Better color and scaling defaults for LaTeX fragments.

   - Customizable list of keys in org-mode to be replaced.

   - Stuck project descriptions have been extended.

   - Emphasis code has been modified to fix some issues.

   - Bug fixes.

** Incompatible changes

   - The option `org-format-latex-options' has changed.  If you
     have customized it, please revert to default and then redo
     your customization.

   - `org-CUA-compatible' no longer modifies S-RET by default,
     because newer versions of CUA don't use this key anymore.
     If you need this replacement, customize the variable
     `org-disputed-keys'.

   - The variable `org-CUA-compatible' is obsolete, please use
     `org-replace-disputed-keys' instead.  `org-CUA-compatible'
     is still an alias for this new variable, though.

** Details

   - Better control over blank lines between trees in collapsed
     view.  This has come up several times in the past and most
     recently by Scott Jaderholm.  There is now a new variable
     `org-cycle-separator-lines' with default value 2.  It says
     how many empty lines there need to be after the end of a
     subtree to get an empty line in collapsed view.  So with the
     default, if you leave only one empty line it will disappear
     in collapsed view.  If you leave two, one empty line will
     remain so that you can use double empty lines to structure
     the collapsed views of a file.  I love it, so many thanks to
     Scott fro bringing this up again.

     One property of the new setup is that you will never get
     more than one blank line in collapsed view.  We could do
     something special to allow *several* empty lines in
     collapsed view, but I think this is counter-productive.

     In Emacs 22, if you want to make full use of this, make sure
     that you have not set `outline-blank-line'.

   - When the clock is running, Org-mode will put info about it
     into the modeline.  The info consists of the elapsed time
     and the heading of the clocked item.  This was a proposal
     from Bastien who got the idea from Muse.

   - C-a can behave specially in headlines when you set the
     variable `org-special-ctrl-a'.  It will bring the cursor
     first back only to the beginning of the headline *text*,
     i.e. after the stars and the TODO keyword, if any.  A second
     C-a will then move the cursor to the beginning of the line.
     If the cursor is already at the beginning of the line, C-a
     will spring *forward* to the headline text.  This was a
     proposal from Leo, based on a request from Scott Jaderholm.

     I have not turned this turned this on by default, should I?

   - When LaTeX fragments are processed into images, there is now
     more control and (hopefully) betters defaults for colors and
     scaling.  Special values can be set for HTML export, so that
     these values can differ from what is used for display in an
     emacs buffer.  The default foreground and background colors
     for images embedded in emacs are now taken from the default
     emacs face.  Thanks to Xiao-Yong Jin for proposing these
     changes.

   - There is now a much better mechanism to change some keys in
     org-mode if these keys clash with other modes you use.  Turn
     this on by setting `org-replace-disputed-keys' (aliased to
     `org-CUA-compatible').  The list of keys to replace is now
     fully customizable, see the option `org-disputed-keys'.
     Many thanks to Meciej Katafiasz for a patch implementing
     this.

   - Stuck project descriptions have been extended.  You can now
     use "*" as a TODO keyword or tag to say that *any* TODO
     keyword or TAG marks a project as non-stuck.  You also can
     give an arbitrary regular expression that, if it matches,
     indicates a non-stuck project.

   - The code for emphasis like bold, italic etc has been
     modified - I might have broken something in the process,
     please let me know if you find problems.

   - A number of bugs have been fixed - those where I have
     replied "Fixed" on the mailing list.

* Version 4.71

** Overview

** Incompatible changes

** Details

  - New variables to customize the header and data tags in
    exported HTML.  These are the variables
    `org-export-table-header-tags' and
    `org-export-table-data-tags'.  This follows a request from
    Scott Otterson.

  - New option `org-format-latex-header' for customizing the
    header of the LaTeX file used to convert embedded LaTeX to
    images.  Thanks to `Matthieu Lemerre' for the suggestion.

  - The prefix version of `org-todo-list' works again.  This
    means that `C-1 C-c a t' produces the list of TODO entries
    for the first TODO keyword.  If you use different TODO setups
    in different agenda files, be careful:  This number now
    refers to the list of *all* todo keywords used in files
    that are scanned for the agenda.

  - Many bug fixes.

* Version 4.70

** Overview

   - Dust settles after revamp of TODO keyword system.
   - The export title can be taken from the first text line.
   - TTY replacement keys have changed.

** Incompatible changes

   - Some TTY replacement keys are changed, see below.

** Details

  - Further development concerning TODO keywords.

    + You can now have several DONE states in a sequence, like

      #+SEQ_TODO: TODO VERIFY | DONE DELEGATED

      The difference to the proposal discussed on the mailing
      list (and which is also works!)

        #+SEQ_TODO: TODO VERIFY | DONE
        #+SEQ_TODO: | CANCELED

      is that in the first case, the extra DONE states will be
      reached with `C-c C-t' (or with `t' from the agenda), while
      in the second case you need S-<right> to get to the special
      states.  I guess both ideas can be useful - I am leaning
      toward using the latter.

    + Setting up TODO keywords in Lisp previously used two
      separate variables: `org-todo-keywords' and
      `org-todo-interpretation'.  The preferred way is now to use
      only `org-todo-keywords', with a new structure:

       (setq org-todo-keywords
         '((sequence "TODO" "|" "DONE")
	   (sequence "BUG" "KNOWNCAUSE" "|" "FIXED" "IGNORED")
           (type "Fred" "Lisa" "Peter" "|" "DONE")
           (sequence "CANCELED")    ; for things we decide to not do.
	   ))

      If your setting has this new structure,
      `org-todo-interpretation' will be ignored.  This change
      does not break backward compatibility.  The old way of
      using a flat list in `org-todo-keywords' and taking the
      interpretation from the other variable still works.

    + When listing *specific* TODO entries via a sparse tree
      (`C-u C-c C-v') or via the agenda (`C-c a T' or `C-u C-c a
      t'), you can now specify several keywords to be selected,
      like "TODO|VERIFY|WAITING".  This also works for custom
      agenda commands.  Thanks to Jason F. McBrayer for pointing
      out this omission.

  - If you have configured Org-mode to export also the text
    before the first headline (this is done by setting the
    variable `org-export-skip-text-before-1st-heading' to nil),
    then the first normal text line in the buffer becomes the
    title of the exported document.  A title set with #+TITLE
    overules this default, and the first line then belongs to the
    normal text.  Thanks to David House for this proposal.

  - TTY replacement keys.  Some of the key bindings used by
    Org-mode do not work on a tty, so replacement key sequences
    are provided on ttys.  In version 4.70, there are some
    changes in the tty replacements.  Thanks to Jason F. McBrayer
    for coming up with the idea to use C-c <cursor> keys.

    | Command           |           | Old TTY       | New TTY       |
    | org-.....         | Main Key  | Replacement   | Replacement   |
    |-------------------+-----------+---------------+---------------|
    | shiftleft         | S-left    | C-c C-x left  | C-c left      |
    | shiftright        | S-right   | C-c C-x right | C-c right     |
    | shiftup           | S-up      | C-c C-x up    | C-c up        |
    | shiftdown         | S-down    | C-c C-x down  | C-c down      |
    | shiftcontrolleft  | C-S-left  |               | C-c C-x left  |
    | shiftcontrolright | C-s-right |               | C-c C-x right |


* Version 4.69

** Overview

   This time the changes affect the following areas:

   - TODO keywords:  Multiple sequences in a single file.
   - Export: More control over text before the first heading.
   - Export: More control over sub/superscript interpretation.
   - Plain lists:  Option to let empty lines terminate lists.
   - Tables: New command to insert hline and move into line below.
   - REPEATing items:  Turn of note taking.
   - Bug fixes.

** Incompatible changes

   - It used to be possible to spread the list of TODO keywords
     over several lines, like

     #+SEQ_TODO: TODO
     #+SEQ_TODO: PROGRESS
     #+SEQ_TODO: DONE

     This is no longer possible.  Each such line now specifies an
     independent set of TODO keywords, with its own DONE state.
     See below for details.

   - The #+TEXT construct has been used to insert unchanged HTML
     into an exported file.  This is no longer possible, the TEXT
     lines will be processed like any other lines.  However,
     there are now much better ways of getting quoted HTML into
     the exported file.

** Details

   - You can now use multiple sets of TODO keywords in the same
     buffer.  For example, you may put the following three lines
     into a file:

       #+SEQ_TODO: TODO DONE
       #+SEQ_TODO: REPORT BUG KNOWNCAUSE RESOLVED
       #+TYP_TODO: Fred Laura Peter Me OK

     Each sub-sequence has its own DONE state.  It is best to use
     different keywords in all sequences, to make sure Org-mode
     does not loose track in which specific sequence it is
     working.  You could use the same word for all DONE states,
     but then cycling through to a TODO state might not bring you
     where you want to be.

     After initially setting a keyword, `C-c C-t' cycles through
     a sublist, i.e. is cycles from TODO to DONE or from
     KNOWNCAUSE to RESOLVED and further to (nothing) and back to
     REPORT.

     S-right and S-left allow to select any keyword, so they move
     from DONE to REPORT and from RESOLVED to Fred.

     C-S-right and C-S-left jump from one sub-sequence to the
     next, for example from TODO or DONE to REPORT to Fred.

     Thanks to Rick Moynihan for triggering this development.

   - Text before the first headline can now be exported if you
     configure Org-mode accordingly.  Either set the variable
     `org-export-skip-text-before-1st-heading' to nil, or use the
     new in-buffer option

     #+OPTION: skip:nil

   - Export content specified via the #+TEXT construct is now
     fully processed, i.e. links, emphasis etc. are all
     interpreted.  #+TEXT lines may include
     #+BEGIN_HTML...#+END_HTML sections to embed literal HTML.

   - During HTML export, you can request to have a_{b}
     interpreted as a subscript, but to leave a_b as it is.  This
     can be done by setting the variable
     org-export-sub-superscript to the symbol `{}' with

          (setq org-export-sub-superscript '{})

     or by using

           #+OPTIONS: ^:{}

     Thanks to Eddward DeVilla for this idea.

   - New variable `org-empty-line-terminates-plain-lists'.
     Default is nil, meaning that empty lines are part of the
     previous list item, and that you can have several paragraphs
     in one such item.  Set this to t if you want an empty line
     terminate all levels of plain list items.

     Thanks to Mike Newman for triggering this development.

   - C-c RET does insert a horizontal separator line and move the
     cursor into the table line below it.  Thanks to Bastien for
     this proposal.

   - Org-mode always offers you to record a note when a TODO item
     automatically repeats, even if you are not logging state
     changes.  The new variable `org-log-repeat' allows to turn
     this off, so that notes are really only been taken if you
     are logging all state changes.

   - Various Bug fixes, thanks to everyone who reported.

* Version 4.68

** Overview
   - Priority handling in the tags view
   - Date/time prompt follows the popup calender, and accepts AM/PM times.
   - Standard references like B4 in the spreadsheet.
   - Improvements to the formula editor.
   - C-j does better indentation.
   - Bug fixes

** Details
   - Priority handling in the tags view

     + Agenda lists selected by tag are now sorted by priority.
       Thanks to Andrew Korty for reporting this omission.

   - Improvements to the date/time prompt.

     + When you move (using S-cursor keys) the cursor in the pop-up
       calendar window while responding to a date/time prompt, the
       prompt is updated with the new default date (Emacs only).

     + You can now enter AM/PM times at this prompt.

   - Changes in the spreadsheet

     + You can now also write B4 instead of @4$2 as a reference in
       formulas.  The column references without specified row can be
       written as C& instead of $3.  Such references make formulas
       easier to read and are now the default way how references are
       shown when you edit existing formulas.  To get the old behavior
       back (i.e. only @row$col references), set the variable
       `org-table-use-standard-references' to nil.

       Relative references like @-3$-2 or @II..III continue to use the
       internal format.

   - Changes in the formula editor (the one you get with "C-c '")

     + The formulas are organized in a more logical way.

     + There is now a menu with commands.

     + When starting the formula editor with "C-c '", the cursor
       immediately moves to the formula for the current field.

     + With the cursor on a reference in the formula, you can use
       S-cursor keys to change the field being referenced.

   - C-j indents the following line correctly whe used in a headline
     or in aplain list item.  Thanks to Leo for this suggestion.

   - Bug fixes

     + Flyspell now knows about special org-mode commands.
       Thanks to Vinod Valsalam for reporting this problem, and to
       Andrew Korty for showing how to fix it.

     + Most other bugs discussed recently on emacs-orgmode@gnu.org
       should be fixed, except the problem with non-ASCII characters
       in tags....

* Version 4.67

   - Expert mode for fast tag selection.
     When org-fast-tag-selection-single-key is `expert', not even
     the selection window is shown, only the prompt.  One more C-c
     gets you the window, another one goes to multiple selection mode.

   - Synchronized with Emacs once more:  Emacs CVS has now org-mode
     4.67.  At least until it causes a problem, then the Emacs people
     will switch back to 4.56.  Lets hope there will be no problem.

   - Code cleanup

   - Bug fixes

* Version 4.66

** Overview

   - Sorting of top-level entries works now if the region contains
     top-level entries, or if the cursor is before the first headline.
     Thanks to "redblue" for reporting this bug.

   - When entering date and time at the prompt, you can now mix
     entering text and selecting something in the calendar.  For
     example, enter 22:15 at the prompt without pressing RET, and then
     click on a date in the calendar.  Both pieces of information will
     be included in the resulting time stamp.  You can also use
     S-curser to move the cursor in the calendar to the desired date
     and then enter 22:15 and press RET at the prompt.

   - When setting a deadline or a schedule, entering a time now
     automatically selects the time stamp format that includes the
     time. Bug report (by means of a question) from Bastre.

   - C-c C-l can be used to convert a plain link into a bracket link.

   - Internal links now match inside (the visible part of) other
     links.  Thanks to Scott Otterson for reporting this bug.

   - iCalendar export of TODO items fixed, see also the variable
     `org-icalendar-include-todo'.  Thanks to Philipp Raschdorf.

   - The number of levels in the table of contents of an exported
     document can now be set independently of the number of headline
     levels.  For example:

        #+OPTIONS: H:4 toc:2

   - The command `C-c }' toggles the display of row and column numbers
     the the current table, to aid constructing formulas.  To try it,
     move the cursor to a table and press `C-c }', or use the menu
     entry.

   - Orgtbl translation functions (introduced in 4.65) have been
     simplified using a generic function `orgtbl-to-generic' that can
     be used for very general languanges.  Writing your own translator
     should be very easy now.  More info in the manual.

   - CONTENTS visibility can be limited to a certain level.  The
     command `C-3 S-TAB' will switch to CONTENTS view and show the
     first 3 levels.

   - Bug fixes.

* Version 4.65

** Overview

   - Orgtbl can be used to maintain tables in LaTeX, and in any other mode
   - Editing Lisp formulas for tables improved.
   - Better structure for HTML exported tables.
   - New "calculation" marker "/" to mark lines that should not be exported.

** Detailed description of changes

   - You can use orgtbl mode to maintain a LaTeX table, or pretty much
     any table in any mode.

     This does *not* work by making Orgtbl aware of LaTeX syntax.  That
     would be a box of Pandora I am not willing to open.  Instead, you
     use a normal Orgtbl-mode table, and a converter program to
     automatically place a LaTeX version of the table into the correct
     spot in the LaTeX file.  The orgtbl-mode table can be maintained
     inside the same file, in a block comment.

     I am providing translators for LaTeX, HTML, and TeXInfo.  For
     other applications, you need to write one yourself - but that is
     not hard if you start from the LaTeX version and just modify it.
     Thanks to Thomas Baumann for triggering this development through
     a request for a table-to-LaTeX converter.

   - In the special buffer to edit the formulas of a table (created
     with "C-c '"), there is now better support for editing Lisp
     formulas.  TAB and M-TAB work like in an Emacs Lisp buffer,
     indenting lines and completing lisp symbols.  With the cursor on
     a line defining a complex Lisp formula, a first press on TAB will
     convert the formula into a pretty-printed version with proper
     linebreaks and indentation.  A second TAB folds the line back to
     the compact form.

   - Tables in HTML export have now additional structure elements
     defined.  The header (before the first hline) is wrapped into
     <thead>..</thead>, and each part of the body (as separated in
     org-mode by hlines) is wrapped into <tbody>..</tbody> tags.  I
     have also changed the CSS style for <td> fields and the value of
     `org-export-html-table-tag' to get cleaner tables. Basically,
     tables now have horizontal lines only where needed, and no
     vertical lines at all, as generally recommended for tables in
     printed text.  I like the new look, but I am not sure if this
     change will find general approval, please throw in your view if
     you like.  Thanks to Scott for driving this, and to goud-H for
     pointing me to the row grouping in tables.

   - In a table with calculation markers in the first column, you can
     now also put "/" into the first column.  It indicates that this
     line should not be exported.  The foremost application for this
     are lines containing only "<N>" markers for narrowing columns.

* Version 4.64

** Overview

   - Email links get better, configurable descriptions
   - When inserting a link, selected text becomes the description
   - Easier access to the list of stored links.
   - Horizontal lines in HTML export.
   - Remember templates and storing of notes improved.

** Detailed description of changes

   - The descriptive part of links to email messages can be configured
     using the variable `org-email-link-description-format'.  The new
     default is "Email %c: %.30s" and leads to

        Email from NAME: SUBJECT

     If you configure the variable `org-from-is-user-regexp'
     correctly, then for email you *sent* this will actually change to

        Email to NAME: SUBJECT

     The subject is limited to 30 characters.  If you have become
     attached to the previous default (look twice, the new one is
     better), use "%f on: %s" as your format.

   - Selecting text before entering a new link with C-c C-l now really
     works, the selected text becomes the description part of the
     link.  Requested by Scott, buggy 4.62 implementation is now fixed.

   - Stored links are part of the history list for C-c C-l, so to
     reach them, you can use up/down rather than completion.  Thanks
     to Raman for this excellent idea.

   - A line consisting only of "-", and at least 5 of them, is
     exported into HTML as <hr/>, as proposed by Giovanni Ridolfi.

   - Several changes to org <-> remember integration

       - You can use `org-remember' as your default command to start
         remember.  It will automatically detect if there is an active
         region and use it as initial content (we will probably make
         remember.el work like this as well).
         Also, when calling `org-remember' in a remember buffer that
         was created with a template, you will again be asked to
         select a template.  The buffer is then re-created with the
         new template, but the old context information.  This is
         useful if you change your mind about the template to use
         (Leo's idea).

       - Besides specifying a default *target* file for a note, you
         can also give a default *heading* of which the note should
         become a subitem.  In many cases this avoids or speeds up
         navigating to the right location.  Both file and heading can
         be different for each template.  Both are non-binding, you
         can change them while storing the note.  However, when you
         exit remember with C-u C-c C-c, these defaults will be used
         without interaction.

       - Templates can specify interactive fields.  During expansion
         of the template, you will be prompted for the information in
         that field.  For example %^t will pop up a calendar and ask
         you to select a date. This new feature follows a proposal
         from Leo, who in the mean time has said he does not need it
         anymore.  But I liked it, so here it is :-)

       - Templates can access information specific to the link type
         created, for example the author and subject of an email.
         Syntax is %:fromname, %:fromaddress, %:subject etc, details
         in the manual.  Proposed by Peder O. Klingenberg.

       - I have been considering to move, at some stage, the template
         functionality into remember.el itself - which would of course
         require consent of the remember.el maintainers.  I am not
         sure how well this would work though, since some things like
         the interactive time stamps are org.el specific, so treating
         them would require special hooks.  Comments?

   - Many calendar/diary commands available directly from agenda.
   - Field copying in tables with S-RET does increment.
   - C-c C-x C-v extracts the visible part of the buffer for printing.
