* Survey introduction

A survey was conducted of org-mode users during November 2007.  An
invitation was sent to the org-mode users list as well as announced on
the http://orgmode.org web site.  About 80 people responded.  This file
contains a complete list of the answers, as the base of further
discussion.

Survey created and summarised by Charles Cave

* 3. When did you first start using org-mode and how did you find out about it?

- Org 5.04, Aug 2007 - Searching around the Web	
- 2007, December found about in in emacs wiki
- November 2006, found it while googling GTD tools	
- moved from planner about 6 months ago
- 2005, probably read about it on Sacha Chua's blog.
- August 2007? Heard of it a long time ago, maybe by following links
  from johnh's notebook mode. Finally switched from planner after a
  friend did the same.
- October 2007
- about the beginning of 2007. Heard about it on the Internet I guess.
- I found it by way of emacswiki.org. I was an avid user of outline
  mode, and found somebody's screencast (Scott Jaderholm's, I think)
  showing off org mode. I've been using it for probably about six
  months.	
- Oct. 2007. I think I was looking for an alternative to planner.el.
- august 27, 2006. I found it while looking for an alternative to
  planner.	
- Roughly 2005/6, through a friend.	
- 2007-Nov. Google.
- July 2007 after I saw the entry in Emacswiki
- april 2007
- 2007-06 through Sacha Chua's blog
- Oldest entry in my archive file is June 2005, but I think I was
  using org for a while before that. I don't remember when I heard
  about it.
- Around version 4.76, don't remember when. Found about it on the
  Emacs Wiki.	
- 10/2006 by chance looking for pim tools for Emacs
- One month ago, found a link on a web site
- 11/2005
- 02/2007 After getting annoyed with Muse-mode interaction with
  outline-mode, I googled and found org-mode and never went back.
- Using for about 2 years. Found org-mode after searching for a better
  version of outline-mode
- Sometime around Jan. 2005. Someone mentioned it on the 43folders.com
  message board (probably Jason F. McBrayer) and I decided I'd check
  it out.
- August 2007. I heard it about it on the planner mode mailing list.	
- 6-12 months ago!
- I read about org-mail from an email of a maillist ... don't know
  which one
- A year ago because someone mentioned it in #emacs on freenode as a
  better planner-el solution	
- 2 months ago when I started using Emacs. I was also looking for a
  way to organize and found org-mode via blogs etc.
- 3 month ago. I was looking forward some emacs "PIM".
- 2007 September
- Can't remember; at least two years ago? I think I would have first
  heard about it from the Emacs Wiki.
- Around May 2007. I don't recall.	
- No idea 6 months back probably; on the wiki site I think
- 2007-08 First heard mention in a GTD mailing list, but realised it
  was going to be great after seeing screencast at
  http://jaderholm.com/screencasts.html	
- 2007
- almost 2 years emacs newsgroups
- 2006-08 (version 4.50)
- approx. March 2006. I don't recall how I found out about it.	
- I think I began using it in 2005. I found out about it on the
  planner list.	
- it's been about a year, I can't remember how I found out about it,
  maybe on the #emacs channel IRC.	
- 2007-03 www.emacswiki.org	
- 1/2007 emacs NEWS
- In 2005, I found out about org-mode while googling for some kind of
  outliner software. My search must have hit upon a listserv post. My
  first try at using it was in June 2005, but I didn't like
  it. Carsten made many improvements and in December 2005, he emailed
  me to ask me what I thought. It thought it was pretty good, and I've
  been using it almost every day since.
- October 2006. Saw orgmode mentioned in comments on 43folders.com
- 2007 July, emacs wiki	
- Around September 2007. I first knew it from planner-mode mailing
  list. I used to use planner-mode.
- Oct 2007
- 2007-09 NEWS in Gnu Emacs 22
- 21 april 2006 (was the oldest .org file I could find on my
  system). Found out through... #emacs I think. dto was talking about
  it.
- I have a "org version 3.05" in my .emacs So it should be from spring
  2005 (March? May?) I read an article in the web, a blog I think. so
  I began using Emacs to use org (uh! :-)
- August 2007 Slashdot article on GTD Wired article on GTD Google
  search for GTD found org-mode tutorial.
- Sep 2005
- June 2007. At may I started learning Emacs for the first time, and
  together all its related modes. At #emacs at irc.freenode.org and at
  EmacsWiki it was mentioned org-mode.
- 2007-04 I was into emacs learning and stumbled upon org-mode I don't
  remember where.	
- 2007 February, emacswiki.org and discussions on the planner.el
  mailing list	
- Sometime before April 2006
- About 1 year ago.
- April 2006 (ca org-mode 4.25) Switching from Planner after numerous
  mentions of org on the planner mailing list.
- October 2006	
- In June 2006. By reading the tutorial here:
  http://dto.freeshell.org/notebook/OrgTutorial.html
- Aug 2005 After trying out Sacha's planning mode i knew it was close,
  but not quite right for me. Googling around I found org mode.
- Probably 2004, before it had texinfo documentation or even before
  the agenda view	
- 2007/10
- 2007-01 I think I've read a blog about it or I've stumbled across it
  at emacswiki.org.
- I started to use org-mode a year ago. I found org-mode on the emacs
  wiki	
- 2007, September, read about it on the pages explaining how it was
  part of emacs-22
- November-December 2006, after googling for "emacs pim". Or,
  probably, there was an article (linux.com?).
- 5/2006, after emacswiki or web tutorial	
- at least as long as the newsgroup has been gmane, as I submitted it
  there. I must have found out on emacs wiki?	
- ~March 2007. I was using planner and I think I saw references to it
  there and checked it out.	
- I subscribed to the list in 8/06. Maybe a month or two before that.
- 2007-01-01
- 2007/01, by a org-mode tutorial.
- I can't remember that. I used to use planner-mode. When someone
  mentioned org-mode on that mailing list, I decided to have a try.
- 2006-03 -- via your (Charles Cave) posting of 2006-03-10 to Getting Things Done
  yahoogroup.
- Around march 2006?	 
- Dunno. A while ago.
- 2006 found out indirectly from the Planner mode or maybe Emacs Wiki
- 2006/06 Emacs Wiki	

* 4. What are your main uses of org-mode?

- daily task planing, private and at work documenting know-hows,
  collecting informations (web searches etc.), contacts
- i plan to use it for GTD and (maybe) as replacement for LyX as
  general writing tool (via LaTeX export)
- Project planning, task management	
- todo list / scheduler	
- TODO list management
- Task list and note taking
- Todo-list administration - Time tracking - Creating outlines
- write lists to keep track of projects and information
- I mostly use it as an extended version of outline mode, as well as
  the agenda mode. Managing TODO lists and the like. I also really
  like the integration with remember mode.
- TODO list, calendar/appointment app, note-taking, "digital junk
  drawer" a la Yojimbo, minor mode for drafting documents,
  org-publish.el, org-blog.el
- Planning and taking notes (with remember mode.)
- TODO lists (GTD methodology) and diary
- Planning, project, time and task tracking.	
- GTD system at home	
- planning
- todo-lists
- Maintaining a GTD system for personal organization, tracking time
  for work reporting and billing.
- Organizing my tasks and plans at work. Trying to implement GTD with
  it.
- Reporting (org-outline/exporter!), GTD	
- GTD, weekly planner
- Managing software development todo lists
- Agenda, todo tracking, lecture notes, blogging
- TODO list
- 1) Maintaining my personal lists of projects and tasks 2)
  Maintaining a "wiki" of reference material (org-mode doc that links
  to external files and URLs) 3) Maintaining an archive of completed
  projects 4) Keeping track of my agenda 5) Outlining and
  brainstorming 6) Organizing journal entries
- Personal task lists.
- daily planning
- Organizing and managing projects
- gtd - project management - generating htmls - minutes, documentation
- notes, todo-lists, planner
- Agenda (GTD) Notes keeping Publishing tool	
- Slowly it is becoming my desktop. I write, use it for email
  composition, technical documentation. Slowly getting into planning,
  agenda etc.
- Project planning and task tracking.
- keeping track of things to do.
- TODO and org-table	
- Running my work and home todo lists and notes, but progressively
  more and more using it for everything.
- TODO list and meeting minutes
- Task/Todo List information list some local hacks for finance	
- todo lists and knowledge base
- Task management (TODO lists) * Note taking * Export/Publish (e.g.,
  publish notes to website) * Personal web pages (via org-publish)
- I use orgtbl-mode most of the time in muse files, that's how I came
  into contact with org-mode. I use it for writing (software)
  documentation, (work related) project planning, and measuring the
  time I work on projects.
- planning my TODO list and more recently my agenda GTD style
- Timeplanning, Timekeeping, Todo/Reminder
- replacement for time management system (todos, project organisation,
  schedules) replacement for spreadsheet helper in LaTeX modes
  (orgtbl-mode)

- 1.) Note taking: web links, links to lines of code I'm working on,
  bibtex entries. 2.) Brainstorming. When I'm trying to figure out how
  to do something, I often fire up org-mode, dump a bunch of random
  thoughts into it, and then organize it into something that makes
  sense. 3.) Experiment logging. I use table node to store pretty much
  all the results I've accumulated for my PhD thesis. 4.) TODO
  lists. I thought I'd use the GTD capabilities on org-mode but can't
  force myself to do it. But still, for little projects, I use the
  TODO lists.
- Action items Notes and lists Tables of passwords Publishing website
- maintain my thoughts, experimental results and agenda
- As a GTD tool to keep all aspects of my life organized.
- Lists GTD
- Just getting used to it. Try to organize primarily work stuff, maybe
  later will get into private things.
- note taking, managing todo's, keeping track of time spent on a
  project and making tables.
- Everything! :-) + keeping notes, + maintaining TODO lists +
  exploiting the Agenda facilities (wow!) + doing project planning +
  writing text and exporting in HTML + a 'database' for experiments
  data (I'm "implementing" it (wow, wow!)
- Task list/agenda/calendar some "filing" of data, storage of links to
  file system and web
- Note taking for courses
- Learn more about organizing tasks - Trying to substitute little
  papers with appointments - Publish works (thesis, articles, web
  pages, ...) - Support a bit the process of writing an article
  (TODOs, deadlines, sections, ...)
- documentation todo list management complete daily work organisation
  private and at work planning of schedules for church and sports
  create customer visit protocols (html for colleagues) I have access
  to my org files via svn world-wide
- all aspects of GTD except calendar
- Outlining and Organising.
- Day to day planning. Constantly switching between gtd and John
  Wiegley's setup to find out what suits me best.
- Todo List management. Task Scheduling. Note taking. Blogging
  (Blorg). Simple Bug Tracking.	
- Organizing my work.
- Managing all my projects and todo lists using GTD, and managing my
  diary/calendar. Basically, I use it to manage my life - home, work,
  social etc. Also use it for hierarchical editing of files etc, but
  that is secondary.
- day planner (in agenda view) - generation of hipsterPDA - easy
  folding documentation tool (write text docu, use folding to hide
  sections I'm not working on currently, and finally generate html or
  LaTeX
- GTD / Agenda	
- I organize all my projects and appointments with org.
- Mainly todos/tasks planning and follow up
- I use it to keep track of articles I have to write for clients (I'm
  a journalist). I keep a page per client. I also use it to keep notes
  on personal stuff, such as sport activities, todo things around the
  house, garden and so on	
- advanced todo list, reading diary, simple HTML authoring.	
- Project management
- note taking, task management, document creation, webpage publishing
- task management, notes about work and home projects, regular
  journaling -- the list of things is expanding as I spend more and
  more time in emacs/org.	
- Project planning, scheduling. Information
  gathering. Wishlists. Outlines. Todo lists (checkboxes). Data
  munging (tables) Review planning (outline w/ links)
- For GTD and basic word processing
- Projects, Notes, Memorial days etc.
- single file for everything
- Amassing and sorting to-dos and reference information. (Recovering
  from mild brain injury in 2005 that affected ability to categorize
  and prioritize, need mechanical aids!)
- Handling notes. Displaying the calendar. Use the agenda view to
  display notes.
- Outlining and providing group TODO lists with explanations.
- To Do List and Project Tracking Writing articles for export to HTML
- Note taking, task management

* 5. New features and product maturity?

Original question:

What new features (if any) would you like to see in org-mode or do you
think the product has reached maturity?

- case sensitive search in tag completion - multilingual day name
  input product has reached maturity in my opinion	
- nothing (for now)	 
- A way to make it more Gnome friendly would be nice. In the case that
  you don't have emacs started, you lose your ideas until you can note
  them down.
- I still haven't learnt enough to fully customize my environment.
- Nothing specific, but I love the current state of development.
- Syncing todos to other devices such as cellphones and palms, I know
  it would not be very easy to do but would be extremely useful	
- No idea, sorry. I think it has enough features at present that seems
  a bit intimidating, really. (Minor quibble -- I changed some of the
  keybindings. I prefer M-left/right to hide/show subtrees, rather
  than cycling with tab, and use # instead of * for outline
  levels. This is mostly habits from a "todo-mode" used on emacs
  in-house where I work.)
- I'm on the lookout for a cell phone that runs Emacs, but... I haven't
  found any mechanisms for remotely adding/editing timestamps,
  changing the state of TODO items, etc. Neither have I found a way to
  trigger reminder sounds, e-mails, phone calls, or IM messages. I'm
  not sure about the best way to approach "mobile org-mode"... A
  web-interface like Webjimbo? More robust import/export/sync to iCal
  or GData? If we can find a way to usefully sync org-mode with mobile
  devices, it'll be just about perfect.
- Current features are enough for me.	
- It is certainly mature. However I would also like to be able to use
  it as a wiki and general-purpose document authoring/publishing
  tool. In an ideal (and possibly unrealistic) world I would love to
  see unification with muse-mode. To what extent is this possible?
- I am still too new to it to comment on this.	
- It's quite mature and I surely don't master it. What I'd like to see
  is easier manipulation of the agenda export.
- Compatibility with other wiki syntax (importer or exporter)
- too soon to know	
- Basically mature; I'd like to see refinement within the current
  feature set.
- You can always add new features! I would like to see an easy way to
  tell how old my entries are. I would like to be able to derive a
  task order based on importance and age (for tasks that don't have a
  deadline but must be completed eventually). Also I would like to see
  it integrated with other tools. I think a MindMap converter (for
  FreeMind) would be cool - although it probably could be an external
  script.	
- Export to WordprocessingML would be perfect. Currently I export to
  HTML and read the reports into Word, saving them as *.doc. But you
  loose some features and details doing this.	
- Integration out-of-the-box with remote calendar systems like Google
  Calendar
- Close to maturity. Some new features would be nice, but not terribly
  important: Keeping root to leaf tree structure when archiving part
  of a subtree. Simple dependent todos (i.e. dependent todo moves into
  "NEXT" state when previous todo is marked "DONE"). Exporting entries
  in HTML in mono-spaced font by default (i.e. without specially
  marking individual entries). Auto-sorting of entries within a single
  parent node (e.g. when a node is marked "DONE", move it lower in the
  parent's list of todos). Integration with project management
  software.
- Some kind of resolution to the line wrapping issue with headlines.	
- Simpler ways of doing things (perhaps with mouse commands)
- I'd say it's pretty close to maturity. I haven't used most of the
  more recently-added advanced features.
- I'd like easier customization of "workflow" steps that would make it
  easier to update states and record notes related to state changes
  (and skip these notes when the state transitions are obvious in
  nature).	
- No immediate demands. I do not think the project has reached
  maturity.
- This product has reached maturity since long! In my point of view
  this is. Excellent work!	
- depending tasks - integrated PDF-generation (especially for
  windows) - visualisation for tasks (like Gantt) - a minor mode for
  contacts like vcard.el
- I think it reached maturity. It would be nice to have some minor
  things, like a possibility to insert todo's right inside your project
  source code and then have them added in agenda automatically.	
- Instead of new features, I'd much prefer keeping XEmacs
  compatibility	
- Wishlist - Adding arbitrary (user specified) relations between nodes
  with a specific relation name. for example, x <part of> y; where x
  and y are two nodes. - Making the above functionality work between
  files - making the above work between nodes published on a
  distributed server In the GNU project GNOWSYS, we do this, where it
  is a web application. We are now exploring how org mode can be used
  as a client to manage the data published in GNOWSYS. Out team would
  be more than willing to collaborate, but our team members are all
  Python hackers, and use Emacs only for coding
- I am having trouble keeping up with the many new features of the
  last few months!
- I think it is mature enough for me
- automatic reminders in Emacs as pop ups?
- I'm quite content as it is. I guess I could probably think of one or
  two things, but I wouldn't want to spoil its power/simplicity
  balance.
-  planing times for tasks and compare them to actual used times (and
  also give out a warning if to many hours are planed for one day) -
  agenda export to latex - simple project management
- a gtd framework would be a killer feature!! more visual effects with
  overlays However, it's "déjà" a very good work. Thanks.
- very mature
- Nearing maturity, but then again, maybe I'm just out of ideas.
- I would like org-mode (or other parts of it like orgtbl) to become a
  minor mode so I can turn it on/off in other buffers (mainly
  muse). For example I would love to use todo list editing features in
  emails. 
- I don't understand all the features yet :)	
- export facilities
- New features, in order of importance to me: 1.) A way to select a
  chunk of text in firefox and paste it into org-mode, along with a
  nicely formatted URL link. I would use this many times a day. MS
  OneNote does this well. 2.) A way to link to email in an IMAP
  folder. Preferably, this link would point directly to the email on
  the IMAP server. The link should look like all the other links, and
  you should be able to just drag it from, say, Thunderbird, into
  org-mode, although a Thunderbird keyboard shortcut would be nice. I
  would use this every day. 3.) More flexible outline prefixes. You
  should be able to make headlines of this type: I. asdlfk i. asdfj
  ii. asdlfkj II. ... Or 1. Introduction 1.1 asdfkj 1.2
  asdfkl 2. Background ... Emacs hyperbole:
  http://directory.fsf.org/project/hyperbole/ did this
  beautifully. 4.) Internal links search in a way consistent with
  emacs search (Ctrl-s). When you click on a link, it should go
  towards the end of the buffer for the next match. When there's
  nothing towards the end, it should wrap to the top. 5.) Fix the
  underline/bold/italic stuff (if that is a new feature) 6.) Better
  formatted html table export
- Better support for working with others.	
- I would like to see different way to view or summarize agenda. Like
  progress, next possible todo
- I think org-mode is quite mature now except there may be still some
  bugs in it and some features may need more polish
- Too novice a user yet to comment
- can't tell yet.	
- I like to be surprised more than wishing
- I'd like better integration with calendar mode of
  emacs. Specifically, when using the calendar, the command 'i d' to
  insert an appointment, the diary file is used. I'd like to set a
  headline in my orgmode buffer for that insert, for consistency with
  the calendar entries I make by hand while processing my inbox Also,
  navigation from agenda to org-file is easy. navigating back is
  harder.
- possibly nested numbered lists: 1. head 1 1.1 sub-head 1 1.2
  sub-head 2 Also lettered lists: a. point a b. point b but I'm
  already quite satisfied
-  implement all features of muse-mode. Ex: list of pages, backlinks,
  following links with Enter, ... - consistent and clear syntax for
  formatting text, which doesn't require memorizing use cases or
  exceptions (ex: *a* isn't bold)
- syncing with my palm would be the greatest need. (syncing with
  outlook would do the job as outlook is synced with the palm)
- mostly small things like an isearch mode that only matches headlines
  (and doesn't auto expand), an allout-copy-exposed-to-buffer
  equivalent, hipster pda publishing
- I've too many ideas to write here. The only thing i can think of is
  not quite org related. A published bison or antlr grammar, so people
  can write org parsers/processors in other languages, and extend its
  integration into other systems.
- Org mode is fairly mature. Only the remaining inconsistencies should
  be straightened out.
- Hard to say, every so often I think of a feature that might be nice
  to have. I have a feeling that alternate views (like the agenda) to
  allow other ways of exploring your information would be handy, but I
  have no concrete ideas yet as to what they might be.
- Better exporting (for example better LaTeX export).	
- The only thing I need is better integration with mh-e (I suspect it
  is already there - just need to find the time to sort it out). Other
  than that I am very content!
-  I always wanted to be able to schedule a task for a specific week
  (as opposed to a date) - I would like to improve the hipsterPDA
  generation (export the agenda view as nice LaTeX, improve the
  cal-tex output, etc)
- Org grows faster than I can learn all those nice features. One
  feature I'd love to see was that the HTML export created docs that
  could be outlined like in an org buffer. I guess that's possible
  with some CSS.
- Task dependency for project planing
- At the moment, I'm still on the learning curve. Org-mode has
  soooooooooo many features I have not even discovered yet. I almost
  daily open the manual pages to see I there is something I can use.
- Probably, customization of built-in agenda view. But I'd rather see
  org-mode streamlined and cleaned of unnecessary
  complications. Properties should be either integrated more tightly
  to replace tags/priorities/etc, or removed.
- Looking forward to some of the dependency ideas.	
- Import tasks from .ics files, include .ics files in agenda,
  eventually include remote .ics files in agenda. Would like an
  updated blogging tool that takes advantage of recent developments.
- I'm working on integration with my email client and web browser --
  it's a slow process because I'm not a programmer, but I'm learning
  bits and pieces about bash shell scripts and grabbing what I can
  from experts already using org.
- I'd like a way to set project (outline item) dependencies and to
  easily list those projects in dependency order. I could do it now
  with properties, a dynamic block and some elisp. I'd use markup more
  if it were more reliable in the emacs buffer. It might be nice to
  have a mode where rigid outline style indenting is enforced while
  editing outlines and lists. Perhaps as a buffer option or subtree
  property. None of this is necessary or worth calling org-mode
  immature.
- Not new features. But perhaps splitting org.el into different
  modules: one for outlining, one for doc format (Wiki engine), one
  for GTD	
- block quote text support. like wiki {{{ This is quote text }}}
  Currently only putting ':' at beginning of text or heading.
- I hope a better archive mechanism using C-c C-x C-c, which could
  keep the structure in my org file.	
- Seems mature; new features always interesting but can add a layer of
  too-many-choices distraction. (See prioritizing problems above ;) )
- New summary type {%} for progress status. Real comment syntax.	
- I use only a fraction of its features.
- Mature	 

* 6. Additional tutorials, documentation and screencasts would you like?

Original question:
Which topics or "how-to" guides would you like to see in the
documentation or as a tutorial or screencast?

- none. documentation is excellent
- how to prepare/export/print GTD file to A7(index cards hPDA (hipster
  PDA) forms
- Everything should be a screencast for new users.	
- I'd love to see more examples (with code) of how people use org,
  especially for implementing GTD.
- More detailed information about blogging would be great, especially
  motivation for using org.
- The manual and refcard usually have me covered. An in-depth
  screencast on table/calc might be nice.	
- More stuff about methodology to use it.	
- Screencasts are most helpful to me. I would like to see material on
  publishing and blogging in particular
- Project lifecycle. Timesheet reports.
- Exporting to other formats and customizing that
- lot of screencast showing new features of org (such as one already
  done)
- The documentation is actually rather good as it is, haven't found
  anything lacking yet.	
- Integration with remember
- Integrating org-mode with pine/alpine mailer.	
- Not sure who you want to target. Advanced users are your bread and
  butter and probably are OK. Beginners should get some screencasts
  that describe a common problem and just focuses an how org mode can
  help them. A good example is something like when someone's todo list
  gets too long and complex and they want to split it, but maintain
  connections between items on various lists, or perhaps view a
  chronological list of all items in one location. Org mode is the
  only program I know of the handles this kind of complexity
  gracefully.
- In depth explanation of using the agenda to its fullest
- I'd love to see one on setting up column views. A tutorial on
  publishing files would be great. And one about creating custom
  agenda views.	
- Changing the keybindings to make specific state transitions easier
  to enter
- don't know as of yet ...	
- using the spreadsheet with merged cells, calculation for rows and
  columns - showing the true meaning of the properties stuff - over
  all there should be examples - i really dislike the manual form
  orgmode.org because it is technical oriented not for the simple
  user - more howtos for gtd -> learning from each other
- Different usages of org-mode. From GTD to other ways ...	
- I find the manual well written and sufficient.
- Use of drawers and properties.
- How to organize multiple projects; auto-archival.
- org spreadsheet	
- Since Org-mode is (to me) a collection of "orthogonal" features, but
  doesn't much impose structure, I'd be interested in seeing how
  others organise their data and "bring it to life" with the Org-mode
  features.
- none
- more documentation for org's lisp functions (in fact more examples
  with org's lisp functions!!)
- remember mode integration
- I prefer the documentation and experimentation. Need drives my
  learning.
- I don't have any preferences.
- Can't think of any	
- I think a new user would benefit from a screencast showing basic
  hierarchy creation and navigation
- Remember Practical uses of properties	
- I would like to see more people to share their ways of using org
  model
- The documentation is already very good and it seems the manual is
  never out of sync from the latest org-mode version. I found the
  mailing list is the best source of "how-to" as people's individual
  situations are so much different.
- more of org for gtd
- how to deal with the calendar and insert dates quickly - two-way
  backends for groupware-like behavior - calender functionality for
  scheduled events (receive popups or emails or sms or the like) -
  probably more but it's too early to say
- drawers + table calculations
- Using org-mode as a calendar/planner. Perhaps a best practice around
  where date- and time-stamps belong (in the headline? in a SCHEDULED:
  property? DEADLINE: property?) Also, it would be helpful to be shown
  the best practices around Categories (since they show up so
  prominently in the agenda) I wanted them to be like David Allen's
  "Contexts", but that's hard for me to manage.	
- All the variables that you must configure to be able to write and
  export an article successfully and without unexpected results - How
  to move from {muse,kwiki,reST,planner,...} to org-mode: how to adapt
  the syntax, ...
- examples of how to columns view
- real examples of different ways of using org-mode
- Scope projects? integrate Org into a software development
  process/project? Handle <not at computer> org interactions?	
- Daily use of agenda
- I'm still not familiar with the more advanced features of org-mode,
  so I'm keen to see these areas explored in tutorials and guides.
- The spreadsheet.
- None that I would be interested in, although I accept that new users
  would benefit from them.
- I think column-view is a great feature. Bastien's tutorial is good,
  but I'm thinking a tutorial focused more on the use case as opposed
  to the config option might be better. If I find time :-)
- I don't know if it's just me, but currently I make no use of
  tags. So any how-to or screencasts of how to use categories and tags
  together in a senseful way would be nice. Most usages of tags I've
  seen so far where tags like :phonecall: or :appointment:, but when I
  have a TODO "Call Jim" or "Meet Jim" those are superfluous...	
- I would welcome such howtos and offer to help. The drawback of
  screencasts is they take a long time, and there is no way a viewer
  can tell it will be useful to sit it all out. A guide giving
  examples (and using short screencasts, if necessary) gives the
  reader an overview, he/she can skip sections and browse to a
  chapter/paragraph deemed useful. I would like to learn howto tweak
  my custom built todo-lists so that some of the statuses show up in
  the agenda, and others don't. Example WRITE should be on the agenda,
  but INVOICE not really. But the intermediate VERIFY should.
- More on GTD. Agenda customization.
- More on column mode and new uses of properties.
- I know there are books and howtos about lisp, but it would be great
  to see some smaller howtos that are specific to org applications,
  and code samples.
- The remember mode stuff scares me. I need to take some time learn
  it. I also know agenda can do a lot more than I do with it. I'd like
  to see screen shots of of column mode to drool over since I'm not
  running emacs 22 yet.	
- can't thing of any
- Spreadsheet examples.	
- how-to setup a gtd style system is always my favorite.	
- Some experienced users' detailed explication of pros and cons of the
  newer TMTOWTDI (There's More Than One Way To Do It) choices like
  archiving methods, task states, etc. leading to -- you
  guessed it -- prioritizing problems
- Building complex agenda views.
- Dunno.	
- Setting up a publishing/blog environment

* 7. Which features of org-mode do you use? (Spreadsheet, LaTeX, HTML, Remember, etc)

- Document Structure, Tables, Spreadsheet, Hyperlinks, TODO items,
  Tags, Properties and Columns, Dates and Times, (Custom) Agenda Views
- LaTeX, Remember	
- Use the agenda/tags views heavily. Tables, but not really
  spreadsheets.
- Remember	
- remember, agenda views.	
- I'm sure I will use everything at some point. I've finally started
  using remember recently, about to start using HTML for blogging I
  think, and can imaging using LaTeX to print index cards even.
- Todo-list, agenda - remember	 
- Remember, agenda, I learned to use the tags / priorities, but they
  don't seem to fit my style of use.
- Publish to HTML and LaTeX (although I'd prefer ConTeXt), dynamic
  blocks, orgstruct minor mode, and hyperlinks. I'm not sure if they
  count as a "feature", but I use deadlines, scheduling, and repeated
  tasks *a lot*.
- remember, clock summary.	
- TODO keywords, tags, timestamps (inc. deadlines/scheduling),
  priorities, export to HTML/ics, tables, archiving, remember, custom
  agenda commands	
- Still exploring.. starting out with fundamentals as described in
  John Wiegley's excellent write-up.
- HTML, Remember
- Basic planning, some html export, Want to use more features of org
  but lack of time
- Remember, html
- Much use of Remember, agenda, agenda todo lists. Some use of HTML
  and LaTeX. A little use of spreadsheet.	
- Starting to use spreadsheets and tables. I use the [/] feature to
  keep track of task counts a lot. I like the "radio" links too. Don't
  use the others much.
- Export2HTML, Remember, Agenda
- Remember, LaTex, ical export, Agenda and Diary integration
- HTML. My usage is pretty basic.
- LaTeX, HTML, Agenda, diary integration, Todo, outlining like crazy	
- Spreadsheet (for tables)	
- I use Remember, HTML, agenda views, hyperlinks, time-tracking,
  timestamps, and tags. I occasionally use tables, and plan on using
  the PROPERTIES drawer in the future. I don't currently use any
  advanced table formulas or column view, but I'm glad they're there.
- Remember, basic task lists, and mostly the Agenda views.	
- LaTex, HTML, Remember, Cal, diary
- all	
- agenda - html - spreadsheet	
- Spreadsheet, remember, time logger and outlines.	
- Document structure + hyperlinks, agenda + remember, exporting and
  publishing
- writing documents, LaTeX, HTML.
- Remember; tables.
- Remember, and the todo features.
- simple to do listing
- A lot: Outlines, Tables, Spreadsheets, TODOs, Links, Tags,
  Timestamps, Clocking Time. A little: Agenda views, Properties and
  Columns Not at all: LaTeX, HTML, Remember I plan to increase my
  usage of all the above, apart from LaTeX, which I'll probably never
  use.
- Remember
- Remember, Latex, spreadsheet (with calc)
- just to basic features
-   * TODO's, including ** Scheduling ** Deadlines ** Archiving (both
  tag and function) * Remember * LaTeX * export/HTML * Tables *
  org-publish * Agendas
- spreadsheet, HTML	
- remember, agenda, priority
- Remember
- all
- Basic outlining with tons of links of most types allowed. * Tables *
  HTML export * TODO's
- Tables, HTML, Remember
- table, agenda, remember
- Probably the question is bettered asked with "which features of
  org-mode do you not use?" :-) It seems I have almost used everything
  except properties and drawers. Although I did not go into depth of
  many of them, like I never used a formula in the built in org-mode
  table.
- tags, todos, links, timestamps	
- remember, agenda
- tables, HTML, ToDo stuff/agenda, column mode, clock features,
  categories	
- Agenda, time tracking, HTML, latex, spreadsheet
  agenda export to ics (iCalendar) file TODO proper- ty drawers
- headings, tags, links, drawers & properties, table (& occasionally
  spreadsheet), remember, todo's
- outlining - basic spreadsheet - org-export-as-latex - HTML -
  org-publish - marking TODO/DONE (or equivalents) - agenda	
- Remember HTML
- HTML, Remember, custom agenda views, tags matches, custom keyword
  states, diary integration, recurring tasks, scheduling and
  deadlines, org-nnml, hyperlinks, categories	
- Agenda, Remember, Tags, Ascii Export, Tables, Outlining
- Spreadsheet	
- sometimes Spreadsheet remember extensively LaTeX/Html export	
- Remember, Blorg, org-publish, Tables, Lists, Checkboxes, TODO
  sequences.
- LaTeX, html, remember, spreadsheet
- Tags, Remember, Diary integration, Logging, sometimes spreadsheet
  usage.	
- folding, TODOs, Agenda view, HTML generation, column-view	
- Spreadsheet, HTML, Remember, fast selection of TODO keywords, links
  to everywhere, extended timestamps and intervals
- Spreadsheet, HTML	
- I use remember very often. I have not really touched the
  spreadsheet, don't need to. I use the deadline feature all the time
  and the [/] todo list type. I have experimented with export to html,
  in order to transport stuff to a very smart smart phone (iphone) but
  that requires more tweaking on my side.
- todo and logging state changes, tags, priorities, hyperlinks,
  remember, timestamps, agenda, export to HTML.
- Folding, spreadsheet, column mode, properties, schedule/agenda,
  org-remember, html export, todo, tags
- I use everything except radio stuff and dynamic blocks, and I think
  I will use those soon. Don't use XOXO export either, I guess.	
- remember, tables, tasks, tags, archiving, calendar, html export, and
  I'm learning a bit about LaTeX.
- In no particular order: tables, plain list folding, checkboxes and
  checkbox counting [/], multiple todo sequences, tags, properties,
  inactive dates, elisp formulas, html export, text export, in-buffer
  markups (*/_), subtree in indirect buffer, links
- latex, html, remember
- spreadsheet, remember, agenda, outline, property, column view
- remember, archive, appointment, diary, timeclock	
- Remember for fast to-do adds; use tables occasionally but mostly use
  dedicated spreadsheet s/w for such functions. Hope to learn LaTeX at
  some point.
- Agenda views Table editing Properties drawers HTML export LaTeX
  export
- HTML. Remember. Tables.
- Mainly time stamps, agendas and HTML export
- LaTeX, Spreadsheet, Remember

* 10. Are there any other comments you would like to make about org-mode?

- Thanks for this great software, I've waited for years for such a
  tool. I've wrote some tools around org in Perl, hopefully I'll find
  some time to contribute. Thanx a lot
- Great tool to stay even longer in emacs OS :-)
- Thanks!
- Great App, Great Support, Great Community
- org-mode is all-the-way cool.
- With the possible exception of Emacs itself, org-mode is my very
  favorite bit of software. It has inspired me to learn LISP, so I'm
  looking forward to contributing in the near future.
- It's fantastic and the maintainership and community are both second
  to none!
- Later. :)	
- Great mode and very useful. Thanks a lot for your effort and time!
- Great Work ! Felicitation to its author
- It's indispensable for my current work and lifestyle.
- It is a great package, thanks for making it available and keeping
  it alive!
- Thanks for the org-mode. I just love it! Do all my personal and job
  planning with it!
- Great tool, thanks thanks thanks :)
- It's fantastic -- thanks for the great tool. I'm getting older and
  it's the only way I can "remember" everything. It's not just a great
  todo list manager, but I use it to document almost everything about
  my job (e.g. my original intentions about a
  project/implementation). I can bury a TODO right down in the place
  where I have most of the surrounding documentation.
- I cannot overstate how valuable this mode is. It single handedly has
  the potential to make laypeople aware of Emacs. Thanks so much for
  working on it!
- Love it. Love it. Love it. Carsten is awesome.
- It's changing very fast, and I'm worried that my muscle memory will
  start to fight against the changes. Still, it's good to see an Emacs
  package with such active interest and support.	
- I'm a happy user. Thanks to Carsten and all contributors
- great guys on the mailinglist, great spirit, excellent product :-)
- Carsten, many thanks for this great piece of software! Keep it
  simple and usable - not everybody follows the power user discussion
  in gmane
- Keep up the great work! :)
- Thanks to Carsten and to people on emacs-orgmode !!
- Been a user of GNU Emacs for the last 18years, never seen such a
  fascinating major mode. I like this kind of apps since I work in
  knowledge organization, and would like to contribute in some
  way. Our lab gnowledge.org would like to develop a java applet that
  provides org mode kind of editing. The buffer thus produced will be
  converted into html when the page is being served in the
  background. This will encourage the community to do structured
  documentation. Our lab is now engaged in developing
  beta.selfplatform.eu, where in we would like to provide this
  feature. Do you think, orgmode developers would like to help us or
  contribute in this endeavor. Orgmode can be very useful for
  furthering semantic computing.
- It is a great product. I does not need to grow. It might risk
  feature creep.
- Excellent package
- Thank you, Carsten!
- Has increased my productivity a lot!
- Really a great thank to the author "Carsten Dominik", "chapeau" as
  they say in France!!!!
- Org-mode was relatively immature when I started using it, and I have
  kept with it for 2 simple reasons: 1. The maintainer (Carsten) is
  friendly, fast, accurate, and thorough 2. It works -- it does what
  it claims to do, and does it well
- Org mode keeps me organized, it's outstanding!
- hmmh, org-mode is the first thing I start in the morning and the
  last I close in the evening, I guess this tells it all.
- Org mode has been an incredibly useful tool that is fun to use. I
  think a main reason for its utility is that basic use requires
  little thought. When I'm using it for brainstorming, it's almost
  like I'm not aware that I'm using any program -- I'm just
  thinking. Any changes to org-mode should preserve this
  simplicity. Thanks a ton to Carsten and all the others who have
  contributed to this great project!
- Thank you Carsten!
- Maybe we should consider a separate package or maintainer for
  xemacs....	
- Thanks, thanks and thanks.
- Good stuff. thanks	
- It's Fun. ASCII is usually the only interface I can get used to,
  because it's so fast.
- org-mode makes me look organised (though a bit quirky). That's
  enough reason to use it.
- Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-)	
- Even if org-mode stands right where it is, it has been enormously
  helpful. Thank you very, very much.
- Well done	
- Yes: org-mode progresses very well and improves with each version
- for me its the greatest found treasure since I "discovered" Emacs.
- Great work! Wish I had time to contribute more.
- Keep up the good work :)
- It's a great software project and community. Thanks again to
  everyone involved!
- Excellent piece of software!
- I'm very very happy with it.
- org-mode is fantastic :-)
- The best feature of Org are its two maintainers Carsten and Bastien
  and its helpful community.
- Great mode for emacs. I wish I was using it more	
- It is great tool. Uncluttered. Thanks to Carsten et al.
- Rock on!
- favorite piece of software I use.
- I'm continually amazed by what org can do, and also by how intuitive
  it is. It's not at all unusual that I find myself thinking that it
  would be great if org/emacs did "x", trying what seems to me to be
  the way that it would do "x" if it could, and discovering that it
  functions just as I expect. And when it doesn't, there are ways to
  figure it out. (And Carsten is a great developer who shines at
  hearing what his users are doing, responding to expressed needs, and
  even being clear if/when he decides not to do what someone would
  like him to do. Other heavy users and scripters are great as well.
- I started using Org-mode as an outliner. It is the best outliner
  I've used an much more. The community is valuable but Carsten's
  skill and judgement has made org-mode what it is.
- It's a killer tool that I could not live without.
- org-mode is great, I hope it can keep clean text file when adding
  functions.
- I forced myself to learn emacs after 25+ years in the vi camp in
  order to use org-mode. Loving it. Carsten's enthusiasm and support
  are a joy, and the mailing list is always refreshing.
- I plan to run a website where users could share Org files and edit
  them together. I plan to write a better exporter (and more formats!)
  I think the Org syntax is mature enough to get more programs
  interacting with it outside Emacs. Org is *great* :)
- It's wonderful. Thanks!
- org-mode is a fantastic program, supported by a lively helpful email
  list. Carsten is very responsive to feature requests and helping.
